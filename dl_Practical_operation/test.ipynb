       "['This is just a precious little diamond. The play, the script are excellent. I cant compare this movie with anything else, maybe except the movie \"Leon\" wonderfully played by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. But... What can I say about this one? This is the best movie Anne Parillaud has ever played in (See please \"Frankie Starlight\", she\\'s speaking English there) to see what I mean. The story of young punk girl Nikita, taken into the depraved world of the secret government forces has been exceptionally over used by Americans. Never mind the \"Point of no return\" and especially the \"La femme Nikita\" TV series. They cannot compare the original believe me! Trash these videos. Buy this one, do not rent it, BUY it. BTW beware of the subtitles of the LA company which \"translate\" the US release. What a disgrace! If you cant understand French, get a dubbed version. But you\\'ll regret later :)',\n",
       " 'When I say this is my favourite film of all time, that comment is not to be taken lightly. I probably watch far too many films than is healthy for me, and have loved quite a few of them. I first saw \"La Femme Nikita\" nearly ten years ago, and it still manages to be my absolute favourite. Why?<br /><br />This is more than an incredibly stylish and sexy thriller. Luc Besson\\'s great flair for impeccable direction, fashion, and appropriate usage of music makes this a very watchable film. But it is Anne Parillaud\\'s perfect rendering of a complex character who transforms from a heartless killer into a compassionate, vibrant young woman that makes this film beautiful. I can\\'t keep my eyes off of her when she is on screen.<br /><br />I have seen several of Luc Besson\\'s films including \"Subway\", \"The Professional\", and the irritating \"Fifth Element\", and \"Nikita\" is without a doubt, far superior to any of these. Although this film has tragic elements, it is ultimately extremely hopeful. It is the story of a person who is cruel and merciless, who ultimately comes to realize her own humanity and her own personal power. That, to me is extremely inspiring. If there is hope for Nikita, there is hope for all of us.',\n",
       " 'I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of the TV series of the same name starring Roy Dupuis and Pet Wilson. The movie was really good and I saw how the TV show is based on the movie. A few episodes of the TV series came directly from the movie and their similarity was amazing. To keep things short, any fan of the movie has to watch the series and any fan of the series must see the original Nikita.',\n",
       " \"Being that the only foreign films I usually like star a Japanese person in a rubber suit who crushes little tiny buildings and tanks, I had high hopes for this movie. I thought that this was a movie that wouldn't put me to sleep. WRONG! Starts off with a bang, okay, now she's in training, alright, she's an assassin, I'm still with you, oh, now she's having this moral dilemma and she can't decide if she loves her boyfriend or her controller, zzzzz.... Oh well, back to Gamera!\",\n",
       " \"After seeing Point of No Return (a great movie) and being told that the original was better, I was certainly thrilled to see that one of the indie film channels was running La Femme Nikita. Then I saw the movie. Ouch! This was a major let-down.<br /><br />Nikita herself reminds me of Jar Jar Binks more than any other character I've seen recently. She comes across entirely as comic relief. The movie simply has nothing to recommend it besides the core concept of an evil, inhuman character paradoxically learning to be human while training as an assassin, and that concept failed miserably in Nikita due to the poor writing of the title role.\",\n",
       " 'Stylish thriller? Hardly! This French action film from director Luc Besson is more confused and unsure about itself than anything else I have seen recently.<br /><br />The opening action sequence shows some promise, and the following action sequences are good. However they are sadly too few and far between. The drama is dull and erratic, and the characters are generally unlikeable. Anne Parillaud and the support cast are unable to involve the audience emotionally.<br /><br />\"La Femme Nikita\" ends up more like a try hard, B-grade action thriller. Very average!<br /><br />Saturday, April 28, 1991 - Balwyn Cinema',\n",
       " \"A Luc Besson (Léon, The Fith Element, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. Angel-A) film with Anne Parillaud (Innocent Blood), Tchéky Karyo(The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The Patriot, Kiss of the Dragon) and Jean Reno (Léon , The Crimson Rivers, Godzilla). It doesn't get better than this.<br /><br />The photography by Thierry Arbogast was perfect, especially the blue lighting at the pharmacy scene. It is easy to see why Besson uses him for his films. He is a master.<br /><br />Parillaud was absolutely magnificent in a character that was a strong woman, and a little girl at the same time. She was a profession, but she was also human. To see this instead of the comic book characters we are so familiar with is refreshing.<br /><br />Reno was a perfect cleaner. Hard and professional. Get the mission done.<br /><br />Jean-Hugues Anglade added just the right touch of sensitivity. Outstanding! There are just not enough superlatives to use in describing the acting and action in the film.\",\n",
       " 'This isn\\'t my typical movie genre. I am more interested in character drama than action movies. This is able to span both genres in a way that Hollywood hasn\\'t managed to accomplish. The plot was interesting and the acting by Anne Parillaud was exceptional.<br /><br />I had seen the American remake, called \"Point of No Return\" and found it to be an OK movie, but I wanted to see the original. I am glad that I did. The technical aspects of direction and editing are very good. The plot was interesting - revolving around the timeless theme of redemption. The acting made this an exceptional movie.<br /><br />For fans of the action genre, they will be quite happy. For those like myself who are more interested in character and plot-driven movies may find this to be a pleasant surprise as well.',\n",
       " \"La Femme Nikita (1990) was a great movie from genre director Luc Besson. The story is about a drugged out young woman (Anne Parillund) who's hung out with the wrong crowd one too many times. During a botched drug store robbery and subsequent shoot out with the police, NIkita is the only survivor. She's tried, sentenced and executed. But, she wakes up in a strange room and greeted by a quiet and subdued individual (Tcheky Kayro) he tells her that she's been given a second chance at life. But will she do what needs to be done in order for her to receive. Will Nikita take this opportunity at a second life or will she throw it all away? Watch LA FEMME NIKITA to find out.<br /><br />The always imitated by never properly duplicated chic thriller has become a fixture in pop culture. Not only was this film remade several times but it also spawned an unrelated television series. Anne Parillund is super hot in her role as Nikita. Watch out for Luc Besson regular Jean Reno as Victor the Cleaner.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\",\n",
       " 'Luc Besson has been behind some of the most provocative and intriguing action films of the last 15 years, and his introduction to mainstream American cinema-goers began with 1991\\'s \"La Femme Nikita.\" Beginning with a drug store shootout that leaves three junkie punkers and a few policemen dead, this film is rapidly engaging and shows off Besson\\'s violent chic. In the fray, only young Nikita (Anne Parillaud) survives, after offing a policeman who had let his guard down at a crucial moment. Facing certain death in France\\'s court of law, she is given two choices: lethal injection, or have her execution faked, and then assume a new life as a female super-assassin/spy. A wild-raised feral child of sorts, Nikita had picked up certain skills on the street that eventually prove to be quite valuable to her government handlers, as she makes things difficult for them and especially her chief mentor Bob (Tcheky Karyo). No secret is made of his affections for her, but he tries to mold Nikita into a valuable person, and he\\'s able to do it with the help of another agent, played by actress Jeanne Moreau, who teaches her the finer ways of womanhood. By the end of her training, Nikita has been modeled into a fine, sexy female assassin. Besson makes no attempts to sacrifice his film in the ways of Hollywood convention, and he proves that the days of female-driven action cinema are not yet dead. Parillaud is compelling, as at first, she almost seems unaware of her identity as a woman. When she isn\\'t taking out high-powered political officials, she\\'s romancing a kind and gentle shop clerk, who falls madly in love with her as she does with him. Lastly, \"La Femme Nikita\" has some of the most stylized and violent action scenes of any movie I\\'ve seen in a while. Luc Besson, with this film and much of his subsequent work, has proved he is one of cinema\\'s most valuable personalities on the European, Asian, and American action film circuits. Also, be aware of a cameo by future Besson \"Leon\" (1994) star Jean Reno as Victor the Cleaner, in what is pretty much an early prototype of his role from that star-making breakthrough film.<br /><br />8/10',\n",
       " \"This isn't the worst comedy of all-time, but that is about the best thing that I can say about this pathetic film. I didn't laugh once, or even smile once during this bomb. There was usually something going on on-screen, so I didn't get TOO bored, but most of the jokes here were simply awful. The final sequence is nothing more than a long series of people falling through doors and stumbling all over the place. Needless to say, it was a fitting way to end a movie that was impossible for me to like.\",\n",
       " \"A lot of people criticize this movie as just being too dumb, but I'm just saying, give this movie a chance. It may not be the best film ever made, but at least it has clever gags in it and also includes a very young John Candy. I saw clips of the movie on the internet and I was amazed on how they were funny, especially the scene when Candy unintentionally almost destroys the entire police station while trying to find a pencil or when he hilariously fails his shooting test in the gun range. Since this movie was barely released in the U.S., you may want to track down a copy of it before it disappears completely. Also look for Peter Cook, Mickey Rooney, and Dick Emery, in what was to be his last film role, in the cast, as well.\",\n",
       " 'Before John Candy was really famous, he starred in this rather silly Canadian movie about a series of kidnappings. He plays police officer Kopek, investigating the kidnappings and getting into a bunch of loopy situations along the way. The only other cast member whom I recognized was Mickey Rooney, playing a trigger-happy hit-man named Trigger (although apparently, Peter Cook also starred).<br /><br />Overall, \"Find the Lady\" is nothing special, mostly a series of gags, but it\\'s pretty fun, especially the end scene. I guess that you could say that it backs up what Michael Moore always says: Canada is the greatest place on earth.',\n",
       " \"Groucho are Carmen Miranda are Marvooolussss together. What a great combination and beauty and the beast. The movie has it all, cheesey musicals, goofy love scenes and Groucho's one liners. Buy it if you are a Groucho fan.\",\n",
       " 'In New York City, Lionel Q. Devereaux (Groucho Marx) and his fiancée Carmen Novarro (Carmen Miranda) are unsuccessfully trying to find a spot in the show business. Lionel introduces himself to Steve Hunt (Steve Cochran), who owns the famous Copacabana nightclub, as an important agent and convinces Steve to see the presentation of Carmen. He enjoys the show and asks for another attraction; Lionel convinces Carmen to wear a veil and perform another song and introduces her to Steve as the French singer Mademoiselle Fifi. Steve hires both singers and Carmen has to change clothes and identities between her performances. When she sees Lionel flirting with a Copa Girl, Mlle. Fifi accepts the invitation to have dinner with Steve, hurting the feelings of his secretary Anne Stuart (Gloria Jean) that is in love with him. The situation gets complicated and Carmen simulates an argument with Mlle. Fifi with her subsequent disappearance, originating an investigation of the police where the prime suspect is Lionel. <br /><br />\"Copacabana\" is a delightfully naive and entertaining movie from a time when the society was extremely innocent and could buy such ingenuous story. The plot, i.e., the double-identity of Carmen Miranda, is totally absurd but the situation of Lionel after the disappearance of Mlle. Fifi was remade by Billy August in 1963 in \"Irma La Douce\". Groucho Marx is funny and responsible for the best moments of this movie; but the subplots with the silly romance of Anne and Steve, and the participation of the weird singer Andy Russell should be better written. The songs are boring and dated in 2009, but Carmen Miranda was very successful in those years and sings the famous \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\". My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Copacabana\"',\n",
       " \"The eyebrow-wagging Lionel Q. Deveraux (Groucho Marx) is tired of dragging down the career of his fiancée, Carmen Novarro (Carmen Miranda), as the untalented half of their nightclub act and quits to become her agent. His powers of persuasion soon get the Brazilian singer a job as a featured performer at the Copacabana - twice over. She is forced to do double duty as herself and as Mlle. Fifi, a veil-covered Parisian chanteuse. The owner of the Copacabana, Steve Hunt (Steve Cochran), insists on romancing Mlle. Fifi, much to the frustration of Deveraux, who has already staked his claim to Carmen. Also frustrated is Anne Stuart (Gloria Jean), Steve's dutiful secretary, who is secretly in love with her boss. Another Copacabana singer, Andy Russell (himself), plays Cupid.<br /><br />An irritatingly stupid script, poor production values and almost no good lines for Groucho spoil this slight musical comedy. Andy Russell, who can sing but can't act, cancels himself out. Carmen Miranda fans may want to skip over everything except her numbers, which are good. Groucho fans may want to skip this altogether, unless they want to laugh at the awfulness of it all and imagine the sarcastic quipster delivering a scathing commentary track.\",\n",
       " \"While I prefer Groucho's humor the most amongst all three Marx brothers, it's just not the same without Chico and Harpo for Groucho to play off of. <br /><br />I had never seen Carmen Miranda in action, though I had long known of her being a performer with kooky hats. Now that I've seen her on screen, I think she comes across as a cross between Marlene Dietrich and Charo - a surprisingly fun mix. She's actually a good foil for Groucho, so I think it's the screenplay that doesn't play to their full potentials. It's still a fairly charming movie, with Carmen taking on the role of two different stage performers and Groucho providing zingers.\",\n",
       " 'After reading the positive comments here and seeing the 1 star rating on my digital cable guide, I decided to give it a chance (plus, I\\'m a big Alan Arkin fan after seeing him in \\'Catch-22\\', \\'Glengarry Glen Ross\\', and \\'Little Murders\\'). And I have to say that it\\'s not as bad as it\\'s made out to be. It\\'s actually really really funny--if you have a certain sense of humor. I was dying with laughter during the scene where Arkin and Rob Reiner started fighting on the father\\'s bed--on top of the father! There were other good scenes: the kids throwing the rocks through the windows, Arkin approaching the basketball player on the court, the crazy Jewish mother throughout the whole movie, \"Keep Out Putz!\" written on the office door and the scene with the comatose dad and the insurance guys. I could go on because I really liked this movie. The only thing that kinda bugged was Rob Reiner\\'s attacks, but eh. What are you gonna do?<br /><br />I think that you have to enjoy a certain type of humor to find this movie funny. During the whole thing I found myself drawing parallels to my favorite sitcom, Arrested Development. Crazy dysfunctional family? Check. Adopting a kid of a completely different race for personal gain? Check. Buring down a business for money? Check. (Episode 2 of Season 1--Top Banana!) Multiple story lines that culminate into one big finale? Yup. And there was even a big wacky ending involving all the family members. Both are very slapstick-y comedies with both dry and over the top jokes. If you love that kind of humor, then you\\'ll really like Fire Sale. If you\\'re more into standard comedies, then you\\'ll probably become very easily annoyed and change the channel.<br /><br />I\\'d love to see a cheap DVD of this movie out in a letterbox format. I remember Fox Movie Channel used to run some kind of promo trailer/short documentary before showing it, so I\\'d love to see that as well. Plus, some of the scenes are very dark. I\\'m not sure if this is the print of the movie or Arkin\\'s intention, but it would be nice to see this movie remastered and released in the future, but that probably won\\'t happen. A girl can dream though!',\n",
       " 'Four stars? - give me a break!<br /><br />I was thrilled and amused when I saw this as a kid - so many unconventional scenes, so many people who don\\'t behave ...<br /><br />Alright this is not that entertaining for people of today who have lost any attention span. And it\\'s not as brilliantly made as \"Where\\'s Poppa?\", also written by Robert Klane, but it does have its moments, i.e. most scenes that Arkin and Gardenia are in. Reiner is pretty inept here as usual, though. Kay Medford is very good as a Mother out of touch with reality. A good cast in general.<br /><br />Some scenes lack a better execution but on the whole this is an original idea that has several subplots which are nicely tied up. Greed, ineptness, dysfunctional families, madness and irritation manifest themselves in many different ways. <br /><br />Most locations are pretty \"awful\" by today\\'s viewing habits but that is the exact charm of this movie as opposed to all the slick and sterile over-produced forgettable comedies of today. The settings make this movie look \"real\" and might tend to make people uneasy about the story because it seems people don\\'t really get their way - no matter how they try. That makes for good comedy because this is how life is when you constantly overreach: You make a fool of yourself.<br /><br />The main problem with this seems to be that the ideas are funny but better production and direction would not have hurt. This could very well be remade but I doubt people today want to see anyone on the screen who is over 40 years old... And that is pathetic.',\n",
       " \"I'm another one who is waiting for the day this movie comes out on video. I also laughed from start to finish, especially when Alan Arkin discovers the basketball phenom. This movie was wayyyy ahead of its time, and those that didn't laugh just don't get the jokes!\",\n",
       " \"The movie is a bit sloppy from a technical standpoint, but it remains the only movie to make me literally laugh myself sick. The Farrelly brothers owe a huge debt to Robert Klane's mining of the twisted humor genre. For years, this was my video holy grail. Finally, it occurred to me that it probably showed up from time to time on the Fox Movie Channel; so, not having it on my cable system, I started buying the monthly satellite programming guides, and when it came up in the rotation on FMC, I had a friend tape it for me. A simple DVD release will not be adequate. This needs the full Special Edition treatment. And oh, how I hope there are outtakes.\",\n",
       " \"This film is about 30 years old. I know of no conversions to tape or DVD. It had a theatrical run of about two weeks partially due to a bad review but nobody I ever met who saw it disliked the picture. The reviewer either never actually saw the entire film or had an agenda to sink it. When I first saw it my girlfriend (who isn't Jewish) and I and the vast majority of the audience, were roaring with laughter. We returned a number of times with friends and family and everyone loved it.<br /><br />13 years later I had the privilege of having Sid Ceasar in my car (I was hired to take him to his hotel) and I asked him about the film. He said that he had a lot of fun making the movie, but the studio provided very limited money to advertise and promote the product. No press, no promotion. Studio politics.<br /><br />Gardenia (overbearing father) and Medford (sweet, but loopy wife and mother) are the parents of Arkin, the older son who lives outside the family home and Reiner (intimidated, milquetoast) who lives in. The family owns a failing, indebted department store. Arkin is married to Anjanette Comer, who desperately wants a child. Arkin claims he is impotent because of the tyranny of his father and the fact that he is the hated high school basketball coach whose team can't even win one game. Ceasar plays a wacky WWII patient at the the VA hospital who still believes that the war is still ongoing.<br /><br />On a road trip to Florida, Gardenia secretly sets into motion a scheme to burn his Dept. store down and collect the Fire Insurance. Arkin and Reiner think that his parents' absence presents the perfect opportunity to prove their father wrong and refurbish and restock the store and make a success of it. They don't know of the plot and go to work. Ceasar as Gardenia's unwitting foil is priceless. The pace of the film accelerates and is replete with a few clever twists. This effort is worth a sincere second look and a re-release.\",\n",
       " \"Rob Reiner is hilarious. I haven't seen the movie in a long time and have trouble finding it everywhere. Some of the humor is ethnic, but to me seems pretty harmless, as well as very funny. I thought there was a lot of good slapstick and madcap silliness.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the movie is not more available in stores or on different internet sites where some individual who had the interest in buying a movie like this would be able to have the opportunity to purchase a funny and entertaining and humorous movie such as this particular movie was.<br /><br />If you can find it, give it a try.\",\n",

Tom Conway as the Falcon looked as handsome and debonair as ever (no. 9/13 \\x96 I don\\'t count those last 3 non-RKO efforts with John Calvert), and had to do without the comedy double act of Clark and Gargan from now on.<br /><br />Investigation of a painting painted by a dead man (with an art gallery eerily similar to the one in Woman In The Window) leads to murder and theft; the Falcon is chased by the cops while he\\'s chasing the baddies all the way into deepest Mexico.

She also uttered my favourite line from all of the Falcon films \\x96 \"My father lived at this inn while he was alive\" \\x96 wonderful stuff! Nestor Paiva played a helpful ambiguous peasant and Joseph Vitale a rather unhelpful serious dancer, some of their best stuff was to come later with Paramount.

It contains some very good second unit material shot in Mexico, so there must have been a large budget for that, as it must have taken at least two or three weeks on location. It took a lot of editing to intercut all that with the actors back home in the studio. Tom Conway is in fine form, and there is some crackling dialogue as usual: 'Are you following me around?' 'I've been doing nothing else since we first met.' No prizes for figuring out who said that. There are excellent performances from two Hispanic actors, Fernando Alvarado is a charming little Mexican boy, and Nestor Paiva is excellent in a major supporting role. Martha Vickers is suitably alluring and ambiguous as a typical Falcon heroine. One would like to have some time alone with her in her dressing room (just for research purposes, of course). The plot is solid, a truly puzzling mystery this time, with so many possible villains that the fingers on both hands seem hardly sufficient.

They break in after-hours (despite a sign near the door in English saying the premises are guarded by the police!), only to find a dead man on the premises. Globe-trotting yarn wants us to believe that New York City and Mexico are just a stone's throw from each other, or that the Falcon is really just a nice guy used to helping out desperate women. Neither washes, with the solving of the crime is rather rote and unexciting. *1/2 from ****\",\n",

The second movie is unabashed marketing for tourism in Mexico - the last shot is of a tourist poster that melts into a plane flying to or from our neighbor to the south. The third movie is a lackluster mystery of sorts with Tom Lawrence at his worst. It is not that all of his Falcon movies are terrible, some are decent.

Forgive me, I haven't watched this in almost 2 years, so my memory may be a bit fuzzy. <br /><br />European Championship - Probably my favorite opening match of all time, D-Lo Brown VS Val Venis was far better (and longer!) than I could have possibly hoped for. Two very capable (and horribly underutilized) guys getting 15 minutes (!!!!) to shine on a huge show...thumbs up! Great stuff! If you're ever wondering why they kept these 2 around for so long, check out this match. <br /><br />Oddities VS Kaientai - Nothing too special here, basically a comedy match. In that sense, it was well done. A couple funny spots, and Kaientai is always money. But all in all, they're wasted here.<br /><br />Hair VS Hair: Jeff Jarrett VS X-Pac - Nothing much to say. I forget the majority of this match, it was nothing spectacular. Then again, I actively dislike both of these guys, so this could have been pretty good and I just ignored it. Check for yourself.<br /><br />Sable/Edge VS Marc Mero/Jackie - Edge fans, pick up this show for Edge's debut! Nothing spectacular, Edge and Mero looking OK, Sable trying her best not to maim anyone with botched moves. Fairly early in her wrestling career, so don't expect anything special. <br /><br />Ken Shamrock VS Owen Hart: Lion's Den Match - Not a technical masterpiece, but very solid, given the environment. Limited space for movement inside the modified cage/lion's den seems to handcuff both guys, but they made it work. Worth watching, if only to see something you might not have see before (this type of match occurred only twice, I believe, and the other replaces Hart with Steve Blackman....who would YOU rather watch??)<br /><br />Tag Team Championship: New Age Outlaws VS Mankind/Kane - Kane no shows, leaving Mankind to defend on his own. If you're a Foley fan, check this out. No one takes a stiff butt kickin like Foley, and there are few examples of that as good as this. Nothing close to the spectacle of some of his other matches, this one is brutally short, emphasis on the 'brutal'<br /><br />Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match - What a great match. This stands out in my mind as the match that 'made' Rock and HHH. Up until this point, they were upper midcarders leading their respective factions. This match proved to me that they're both very capable of working a main-event caliber match and delivering HUGE. Not as much emphasis placed on high spots in this match, it seems to focus more on (again) brutality and storytelling. VERY well done, one of the forgotten great matches. <br /><br />World Championship Steve Austin VS Undertaker - A very well done match, especially considering Austin was knocked silly when they knocked heads about 3 or 4 minutes in. Not the greatest match of all time, but an important match nonetheless. The second PPV title match for these two, the first with Austin defending. Great (and unexpected) high spot features Undertaker attempting a huge legdrop from the top turnbuckle onto the announce table. Impressive visual for a guy that size. Good match, great show, check it out!\",\n",

Back in the late 90's D'Lo could really work a decent match, but as of his recent performances on Raw in 2008 I'm not impressed anymore. So basically these two go at it for with WWE's now defunct European title on the line. Venis looked pretty good in the ring, his character was still relatively fresh at this time. But anyway towards the end of the match Val gets himself disqualified, which means D'Lo retains the title.<br /><br />Match 2: The Oddities (Kurrgan, Golga and Giant Silva) (with Luna Vachon and The Insane Clown Posse) vs Kaientai (Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo, Mens Teioh and Sho Funaki) (with Yamaguchi-san) in a Handicap Match - Extremely weak match. I did like the Oddities as comic relief, but guys like Kurrgan and Golga did better as singles wrestlers. This, as J.R. says in the commentary, is not a classic. Anyway the Oddities squash their way to a victory over Kaientai.<br /><br />Match 3: Jeff Jarrett vs X-Pac in a Hair vs Hair Match - The first good match of the night. These two put out a very crowd pleasing match at this particular Summerslam. X-Pac is able to score the win, but Jarrett retreats from getting his hair cut. He is brought back to the ring shortly and they cut his formerly long hair into the look he had all through WCW and in TNA.<br /><br />Match 4: Marc Mero & Jacqueline vs Edge & Sable - A great way to get the young Edge over. Edge has always been tremendous in the ring, and even though he faces off with the talentless Marc Mero, he still manages to put on a decent match. In the end Edge and Sable get the win.<br /><br />Match 5: Ken Shamrock vs Owen Hart in a Lion's Den match - This match was off the hook. Owen Hart completely ruled the ring, if it wasn't for his death he would have been WWE Champion at some point. This match was absolutely awesome. Shamrock is able to defeat Owen in the end, but I still applaud Owen because he was such a great wrestler. He's a guy that needs to be in the WWE Hall of Fame.<br /><br />Match 6: Mankind (c) vs The New Age Outlaws for the WWF/E Tag Team Championship - This was just a low and lame match. Kane is the tag team partner of Mankind, but he doesn't show. So Mankind is left to fend alone against Road Dogg and Billy Gunn. In the end they get the win over Mankind and claim the Tag Titles again.<br /><br />Match 7: The Rock (c) vs Triple H in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship - The match of the night. These two incredible veterans put out a great match. At this point both the Rock and the Game were on the verge of becoming main eventers, and I think this match made it for them. Honestly a fantastic, must watch, match. In the end Triple H grabs the title to win.<br /><br />Match 8: Stone Cold Steve Austin (c) vs Undertaker for the WWF/E Championship - Great main event. Really one of Summerslam's best matches of all time. Madison Square Garden completely was behind Austin as he went into battle with the Undertaker for his championship. After a vicious battle, Austin hits the Stunner to retain the title. Crowd was completely ecstatic.\",\n",

Oddities took on Kaientai in a fun match, X-Pac took on Jarrett in a haircut match, Edge was Sable's surprise partner as they took on Marc Mero and Jacqueline, Shamrock took on Owen Hart in a boring lions den match, Mankind went alone in a handicap hardcore match against the Outlaws which only lasted 5 minutes but it was pretty brutal for the 5 minutes, Triple H and the Rock had a decent ladder match but can't be compared to others, and in the main event Steve Austin defended the world title against the Undertaker, overall another good Summerslam and one of the best ever\",\n",

The story involves the inaugural flight of \"Maiden One\" the first supersonic transport plane. (The movie ignores the fact that it was a British-French conglomerate that first built the Concorde, and had to sue for the right to land in America during this time.) In this movie, we have a disgruntled worker who sabotages the flight by putting detergent in the hydraulic lines in order to get revenge on his boss (Burgess Meredith).<br /><br />We also have Doug McClure trying to get back into Tina Louise\\'s pants, Billy Crystal playing a rather fey steward, John Delancie in training for his future role as Q, and Peter Graves as one half of a former May-December romance. Did I mention that there also happens to be a plot line about the airplane carrying the Senegal flu, which is now spreading among the crew? If you don\\'t have sabotage, you\\'ve got the untamed strain of flu floating around.<br /><br />There are two references that date this movie. One is a reference to the \"Swine flu\". The other is the way that Burt Convy discusses abortion with his bimbo girlfriend -- the concept is mentioned, but she won\\'t let him say the word.<br /><br />The movie does have a reverse natural selection -- the megastars like Meredith & Graves die, but losers like Convy, McClure, etc. live to make another bad TV movie.

I took off within a few days and with no hotel, old French and a small bag, I landed in Dakar. It turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life. For that reason, this movie for me is a 10!

Jiger is a monster who came back because some construction workers take away a statue that supposedly keeps JIger from escaping.

The only really interesting aspect of this film is how Jiger infects Gamera with eggs of hers that later hatch inside of Gamera.

Cubans rule! Sorry! Being a Cuban American, just had to say it!). The hardening of this tangled web is the time when their lives intertwine into a central fixated message about the love of life. The cast was nothing short of stellar! Respected Spanish actor Javier Camera again demonstrates why the camera loves him with his astute performance as the ex-convict Mikel. Nathalie Poza was stunning as the stressed social worker mom Ana. Eman Xor Ona was sturdy as the Miami dreamer Carlos. The screenplay of \"Hard Times\" must have been a hard one to develop because of its crossover components but I do commend Cuenca and Alejandro Hernandez for their triumphant scribing effort.

The protagonist Julietta heads up with her friends from Stuttgart to see her boyfriend Jiri and promptly loses him in party fervour and drugged out disorientation.

It is as if he wants to make a film about youth culture and troubled emotions, absent parent figures and city life. But all he does is churn out a conventional tale with a supposedly unconventional twist in the plot.

This was an example of the expression \"jumping the shark\"--it was obvious it was all downhill for the show from then until its cancellation--and with crappy episodes without the original formula, it wasn\\'t long before the show breathed its last. Frankly, I just found it embarrassing to watch towards the end. My recommendation is never watch this incarnation of the show and use massive amounts of denial. Convince yourselves and others it never occurred---the ONLY shows that ever existed were Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain. They NEVER paired the mice with Elmyra--no, never!!',\n",
       " '\"Captain Salvation\" could have been a segment of \"Intolerance.\" In 1840, faced with blind discrimination, unfounded gossip and strict religious judgment, Anson Campbell, a seminary student, retreats to the sea. There, through a series of unfortunate events, he is reborn to his faith, \\'baptized\\' by the fallen woman who has enlightened him. <br /><br />Most performances are standard, but Pauline Starke\\'s work is excellent. George Fawcett\\'s character, Zeke, provides some of the story transitions by being around when the transitions occur. It is a critical function in silent movies too often provided by title cards alone(in talkies, by a narrator or other dialog). Generally, this picture is very smoothly directed by John Robertson. <br /><br />Cinematography by William Daniels helps this picture shine. The new orchestral score by Philip Carli (TCM induced, I think)is great.',\n",
       " \"I was fortunate to be sent a copy of this movie after my plea. It was worth it as it was a far better movie than I had expected, it not being one of the most well known of silents. Everything about this movie was class and to top it all off, the soundtrack by Philip Carli was just perfect and the print was crystal clear. The direction by John Robertson was first class, again considering that he was not one of the more well known directors of the time and the photography was the usual high standard that we expect from William Daniels. The cast were all excellent, Lars Hanson was superb as the tormented title character Anson Campbell, he has been accused of over acting, but, Anson Campbell is a man who is losing his faith and heading for a mental breakdown to boot and Hanson portrays that with chilling clarity at times, though admittedly he was a little over wrought in some later sequences. Pauline Starke was absolutely amazing as Bess Morgan, she made you care so much about her and you truly believed in her character as a woman who has endured so much sadness and has hit rock bottom as a whore, but, is willing to seek redemption and change her life. Marceline Day was excellent as Mary Phillips, so much in love with Anson, but, still putting her faith ahead of her heart. This was a film that questioned the personal interpretation Christian charity in a manner that I found surprising for a film of that time All the cast was superb and the settings of a small New England harbour town was excellent, the shipwreck scene was very well done. All in all an excellent movie and if TCM show then I recommend it 100%. Special thanks to Paul, without whom I'd have never seen this treat. Hey TCM UK, when are you going to show more silent classics like you do on the other side of the pond?\",\n",
       " 'As was noted by Cine Tiger, this excellent silent film was offered by Turner Classic Movies on their Sunday Night Silent feature.<br /><br />\"Captain Salvation\" was beautifully photographed, and although it does show the difference in the movie-making of that day to this day, it was a captivating journey. Marcelline Day was simply excellent in this film. My original vote for this drama was a 6 but after reflection, I raised the vote to a 7 because some of the scenes were so very haunting.<br /><br />The newly added soundtrack for \"Captain Salvation\" was most enjoyable.<br /><br />Plaudits all around to the restoration team, to the music composer, and to the Turner Classic Movies channel and its executives. This was a great film to restore and it was definitely an enchanting story to view on a quiet Sunday night. This movie also gives the lie to those modern cynics who say that spiritual or religious themes in movies are passe\\' or \"old hat.\" Not so. Granted, this was truly a \\'20s movie and the 1920\\'s had an element of resurgent Christian fundamentalism in that era, a resurgence which contrasted so very sharply with the age of \"flappers, flivvers, and fol-de-rol\".<br /><br />With many other classics of the \\'20s awaiting restoration, we can only hope for the best and for the immediate rescue of these cultural documents from our true American history !! Let\\'s hope TCM shows this one again and again.',\n",

I remember watching it real late at night. I think the intro and the end credits were somehow \"scary\" to me. At the end, as the credits are rolling, there is a cartoon of a \"macabre\" parade walking by. I still remember that to this day. One of the cartoon characters is carrying his own head. I\\'m 50 years old now and it\\'s funny how a person can remember insignificant stuff like that over the years. I sure wish this movie would be released on DVD.

Add a race against time to save a kidnapping victim who's been buried alive and you've got the elements of a tidy thriller.<br /><br />My understanding is that the novel this was based on, THE CONCRETE GARDEN if I remember the title correctly, was actually written by several mystery writers. It was a project where writer A came up with the concept and wrote opening, then passed it to writer B who developed it and threw in complications that would make writer C sweat bullets to resolve. The fact that there were so many writers involved seems to have made it very difficult to get the rights to the story, and that's why it's the only one of William Castle's thrillers not available on video.<br /><br />We've seen remakes of several of Castle's works.

The performances are well acted and the film manages to keep a decent level of intrigue and curiosity throughout. It\\'s also unusual to see Jim Backus in a rather unlikable role. However, being advertised as a \"horror\" film, it fails to provide enough ample shocks to please in that department and it lacks some of the chills and humorous touches of Castle\\'s later work.

       " \"The last time I saw this film must have been nearly fifteen years ago. During that time, although I had forgotten the title entirely, there were aspects of this film that stuck in my brain and likely contributed to a few random dreams; I remember not really following the plot as a child, but I recalled finding it A) very beautiful, and B), unbelievably dark. Certain scenes and characters have stayed with me with dogged persistence---a swarm of jellyfish that seem to electrocute or burn their victims to death rather than poisoning them; the deaths of two juvenile characters that hammer home the realization that, like in the film *Cube*, every last character is expendable; and the image that probably haunted me most of all, the scene towards the end involving a forced cocooning that speaks volumes about parental coercion and a pigheaded refusal to see reason. Many reviewers have compared the story to Romeo & Juliet, and although I wouldn't have understood the analogy as a child, I'm sure I recall the realization that, however majestic and omnipotent the combatants (Sea and Fire, in this case), the conflict presented is nothing more than a childish feud, a pointless and senseless sparring match that will probably never see a true victory. Pretty disturbing themes for a film allegedly for children! Now that I have recently rediscovered the title(s), I would greatly enjoy finding this film again, if only for old time's sake. It's rare that a film leaves such a long impression on me, and for all those out there who also were touched by this film, I'd recommend it in a double billing with Martin Rosen's *Watership Down*, a similarly lovely and chilling animation.\",\n",

It is my favorite animated movie because of how beautiful it is. I used to pretend I was Princess Malta every night before I went to bed. Please try to find and see it if you are a lover of pretty things. My favorite thing about this movie is how sacrifice is romanticized. The only downside is the overused Romeo and Juliet theme, albeit, the story deviates from the older story enough to fool younger viewers. Malta is drawn very beautifully and so is Oceanus, the sea god. It is very dreamy and beautiful to journey into the world of \"The Sea Prince and the Fire Child.\"',\n",

The score for the film gave me goosebumps even as a small child. Definitely a must for any anime fan. I was overwhelmed with excitement when Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind came back into print on DVD this year.

Palance is a gunfighter who wants to change his lifestyle but knows that the odds are against it. But he takes upon himself the mission of turning his revolted son Tony Perkins into a better person. In this task he is helped by his former mistress Elaine Aiken with whom he wants no more involvement. There is quite a sensual chemistry between Aiken and Perkins. I wonder why such a talented, good looking woman like Aiken made so few films.

Therefore, I am going to try and leave my own political persuasions out of this review although I definitely have a viewpoint about what was happening in Iraq and the need for US involvement there.<br /><br />*** This may contain spoilers, although this is a simple documentary with no plot, so there ain\\'t much to spoil.*** <br /><br />After all the hype about Michael Moore\\'s slanted, biased, and intellectually dishonest film Fahrenheit 911, and all the celebrity hubbub about how George Bush is an evil so-and-so and our involvement in Iraq was simply about obtaining oil, I thought I might have a look at what the other side (who gets far less sensationalistic coverage in the national media) had to say about the whole situation. I had heard that this documentary was particularly brutal and difficult to watch, but I thought it was important to see just what was going on in Iraq before the US dismantled Saddam Hussein\\'s regime.<br /><br />It was brutal, it was grotesque, and it was very difficult to sit through. We are treated to footage of people\\'s arms stretched out across two concrete blocks and then being broken with axe handles; we see fingers hacked off, then the screaming, bleeding victim tossed aside to fend for himself; we see hands amputated surgically and tongues clipped out\\x97all these horrific atrocities committed by way of punishment in the name of \"justice\". We see torture, murder, and disturbing footage of women being publicly shot or stoned to death for \"crimes\" such as adultery.<br /><br />My problem is that the documentary, hosted by some boring, no-name yobbo in a suit and tie, frequently wanders from its supposed focus in favor of showing gruesome footage. At first it feels, albeit unpleasant, at least informative; however, as the film wears on, it becomes even more unpleasant, loses its informative nature, and begins to feel distinctly exploitative in tone. I found that shift in tone more disturbing than the film itself. The film ends with every videotaped beheading they could find. I had seen many when they were current news, believing it important to see what the enemy (terrorists and radical religious fundamentalists) was all about, but I just couldn\\'t stomach re-watching these cold-blooded, grotesque murders again, presented as they were in the guise of \"infotainment\", and turned the movie off.<br /><br />In some ways this film shows some important things that were happening within Hussein\\'s Iraq that folks like Sean Penn either didn\\'t see or chose to ignore. It will make you appreciate living in a free country where you don\\'t have your tongue cut out or your hands amputated for displeasing a mad dictator. The US got involved in Bosnia and Somalia based on concern for the genocide occurring there, how could we in fairness turn a blind eye to Iraq? Saddam Hussein actively and arrogant defied every UN sanction and action taken against him, including those he agreed to in order to end the war in 1991, but the UN clearly wasn\\'t going to do anything about it, especially with corrupt UN officials making under-the-table deals with Hussein. Who else but the US would have taken steps to correct this injustice? These are all good points made in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />But the film\\'s weakness is where it loses its focus on the reasons we went there and simply becomes a parade of gore, brutality, and murder. Although it has its good points, I can\\'t in good conscience recommend it as a good, well-made documentary.<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Brent',\n",

This is combined by the subtle observations of Iris, which I suppose aren\\'t as exciting as blowing someone\\'s head off or toilet humor, but intriguing nonetheless.

Iris is the one that stays the longer and she is the one that discovers the mystery of the missing things in the office, but alas, it\\'s too late, because at that time she leaves the temp job.<br /><br />Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow and Alana Ubach, are perfect as the four temps. Toni Collette has a better role where to shine as most of the story is seen through her eyes. Parker Posey is delightful as the free spirited Margaret. Lisa Kudrow also makes a good contribution with her pathetic Paula. Helen Firzgerald, who only has a few lines, cast a giant shadow as the creepy new employee that wants to make friends with Iris, only to be ignored.<br /><br />The Sprecher sisters created a film that feels real a situation one has seen is prevalent in the office setting.',\n",
       " \"I saw this on cable last night, just 2 days after seeing the Sprecher sisters' latest film, 13 Conversations About One Thing - that was the reason I stayed up til 2:30 a.m. to watch it, in fact (please read my review of 13 Conversations, posted yesterday). This film is linear - one scene following the other chronologically - and therefore not as challenging to the viewer as 13 Conversations, but it does leave its mark (as one character in the movie has been told to do). <br /><br />Writer/Director Jill Sprecher is extremely adept in nailing down specifics, and this gift for detail is in full evidence here. The film is about fear, lunch hours, pettiness, toilet paper, loneliness, rubber band balls, despair, paper clips, friendship, pencils, desperation, cocktail garnishes, anger - downright fury, actually - at being marginalized by the illusion of society - and much more. Toni Collette's face is still in my memory - her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes, her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers (and specifically, seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles), the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear. <br /><br />It's a small slice of life, Clockwatchers, but it's an important slice, one that anyone who has ever interacted with anyone on a daily, money-driven basis can relate to. If you've ever held a job, I'm saying, you will see yourself mirrored in at least some of these meticulous details.\",\n",
       " 'Blistering black comedy co-written by Jill Sprecher (who also directed) and Karen Sprecher, \"Clockwatchers\" gives us a suffocating office setting so vivid and real I half-expected my own co-workers to show up in it. Toni Collette plays the new temporary in a nondescript building wherein office-incidentals are slowly disappearing from the supply cabinet. The ensemble acting is delightfully accurate, and the strife which ensues in this scenario is comically overwrought and horrifying. Sprecher\\'s direction is focused and brave (no overtures to broadly comical sensibilities), and she nimbly stretches the film\\'s satirical edge quite far without faltering. The movie is a genuine American original, and by the final third I couldn\\'t wait to see it again from the start. ***1/2 from ****',\n",
       " 'Is this movie slow? Occasionally boring? Kind of depressing? Yes. Unfortunately, that is the reality of working as a temp in an office! Take it from one who\\'s been there. I spent several years temping on breaks from college in the late 80s, and this movie brought it all back, vividly. The office politics, the way the permanent workers \"look down\" on the temps, the menial and mind-numbing tasks, the good old boys (mostly white males, at that time) who were in charge and above it all. Not all of my jobs were as horrible as the office depicted in this movie, but enough were that it occasionally gave me chills. I hope that things have improved, with the proliferation of computers and other advanced technology, at least in terms of the work itself. But I can guarantee that in some places, that temp vs. perm \"caste system\" will always be there, regardless of how the jobs get done.<br /><br />The performances in the movie were excellent. I really liked Parker Posey\\'s exuberant portrayal, as well as Toni Collette\\'s studied, more subtle effort. She expresses so much pain and frustration through her facial expressions and quiet, even-toned narration.<br /><br />The movie is not for everyone, and some viewers will no doubt be bored and/or confused by it. But if you\\'ve ever been a temp of any kind, or worked in an office, I think it will resonate with you.',\n",
       " 'When the credits started for \"Clockwatchers\" - Toni Collette, Parker Posey and Lisa Kudrow - the senior citizens around me in the art house theater complained they hadn\\'t heard of anybody. (There were also choice bit roles by James Elliott of \"Jag,\" Bob Balaban and Paul Dooley and they didn\\'t recognize them either.) There was a row of young kids in the front for some reason who talked as much as the seniors through the movie and kept going in and out to get food and slamming the door. All of which is hard to take during a comedy. <br /><br />This is a great movie for those of us in unsatisfactory office cubicle jobs - ideal for those in temp hell. Not necessarily laugh out loud funny all the way through but biting social satire about office life today for those at the bottom end of a ladder that doesn\\'t go anywhere.<br /><br />Collette\\'s central character is almost too bland and vacant towards the end as there\\'s no ringing conclusion just some small revenges, but it\\'s all in character and place. <br /><br />Kudrow gets to be a bit nastier and practical life-facing than her usual roles.<br /><br />Clearly the sister creators of this movie have spent some time as temps! And temporary office placement companies are now the largest employers in the country.<br /><br />(originally written 5/26/1998)',\n",
       " \"I'm surprised how many people see this as a boring film that does nothing but chronicle the minutiae of modern-day office life. 'Clockwatchers' is a relationship film which also examines the lives of the new breed of second-class citizen in the late 20th century workplace, the temp.<br /><br />Iris (Toni Collette) is a meek temporary hire who stands out about as much as the Muzak at her new assignment, a large credit firm. Luckily she's taken under the wing of Margaret (Parker Posey), the Artful Dodger of the firm's temps who shows her how to survive in this impersonal world. Along with Paula (Lisa Kudrow) and Jane (Alanna Ubach) they form an us-against-them support group and Iris begins to come out of her shell as a person as well. Soon Margaret is conducting a guerilla war against a permanent hire (Helen FitzGerald) who gets a job Margaret had been aiming for and who is almost a mirror image of Iris when she came to work a few weeks before. The office drama is played out in great detail, and the solidarity of the temps is one of the war's casualties.<br /><br />This is a fine, above-average first effort from director Jill Sprecher, who wrote the screenplay with her sister Karen. She's obviously keen to show her skills here, and sometimes she directs the movie like it was 'Citizen Kane,' but that's not much of a fault. A little more serious problem is that after its climax the film loses some steam moving towards the denouement, but overall the screenwriting sisters have produced an entertaining film that speaks with authority on its subject. Let's hope they find regular employment.\",\n",

Here you have 4 women who are capable of so much more in their life, yet they\\'re so afraid to act on their dreams that they settle for crappy temp jobs. Excellent acting by Toni Collette in the lead role as \"Iris.\" Nods to Parker Posey as well. All the girls nailed their parts strongly, and the strong acting along with a great script created a very real and believable story with real and believable characters.

I would rather watch a movie about these four girls than most movies readily offered to me. Watch the movie. Enjoy it.

The characters are dull, the plot is dull, the temps are so helpless and constantly humiliated that it becomes painful to watch. Toni Collette's narration is annoying, precisely because it is obvious this is her coming of age story. Her big revelation at the end of the film is to dupe a superior into signing a recommendation letter as a favor to a friend. That's her big breakthrough after an hour and a half of being very mousey and shy. The four temps who look so playful and happy on the box cover are miserable in the movie, partly because they're temps and partly because they don't possess the ambition or skills to be much more than that. I was expecting a comedy, at least a black comedy, but this was a very bleak story of hopelessness and despair with the friendships evaporating due to mistrust of one another.\",\n",

       " \"The four leads are very effective as the disaffected temps, pariahs in a generic office. They are ably supported by veterans such as Stanley De Santis and Bob Balaban. For its first forty minutes, Clockwatchers effectively creates a Twilight-Zonish office hierarchical atmosphere with our heroines as the office pariahs. Then it spends its last hour expounding upon the fragile and transitory nature of office friendships amidst corporate backstabbing for advancement and survival -- especially among temps. After the first hour, it is the viewer who is the clockwatcher as it winds down with no additional insights, humor, or surprises. I'd give the first half a 7, and the second half a 1, which leaves me with a 4.\",\n",
       " 'I have never worked as an office temp before, but after seeing this movie, I have a very clear image as to what it must be like. The film does a perfect job of making the viewer feel like part of the office community (which isn\\'t always a good thing to want to feel). After the movie was over, I felt somewhat void and numb - and very tired. That is the exact effect that this film should have. The business world allows for no individuality or creativity - instead, it silences one\\'s spirit.<br /><br />Toni Collette is wonderful as Iris. I have known so many people like this character - quiet, shy, someone who lets life go by without making his/her mark. I have also known many people like Margaret (Parker Posey) - people who need to be seen and heard at all times. And this one of Parker\\'s greatest performances. She goes from a bouncy free-spirit to an aggressive troublemaker to an outcast without warning, and her transformation is fascinating to watch. Lisa Kudrow, too, gives another great performance (and this was before her scene-stealing role in \"The Opposite of Sex\") as the possibly compulsive liar Paula. The fourth actress, Alannah Ubach, I have not seen in anything else, but she is absolutely a delight to watch. Smaller roles by actors such as Jamie Kennedy, Bob Balaban (Posey\\'s costar in \"Waiting For Guffman\"), and David James Elliot are also performed with perfection. If you appreciate a movie about interesting characters in everyday situations, then this is a movie for you. Many people have complained about the slow pace, but I have never found this to be boring. The slow pace is effective in making viewers feel as desperate and unimportant as the temps. 9/10',\n",
       " 'Funny women Posey and Kudrow star in this popular indie film about office temps in the city and the none-too-bright future they have in this increasingly paranoid and indifferent job field (if it can even be considered one.)<br /><br />A lot of cute office shtick in the beginning (though nothing you haven\\'t seen done better in \"Clerks\" and \"Office Space\"), but the climatic story of the office-snitch is what killed it for me. Completely cliché and predictable. If you don\\'t know who it is the moment the drama starts you have seen very few movies in your day and the character herself (no I won\\'t spoil) is a tried and true trite stereotype that is more plot device than any character at all. <br /><br />Still both an amusing and somber look at this joke of a job \"opportunity\" that awaits many a young woman. The cast is very good, I wish the story would have been better written. I disagree with the critics, \"Party Girl\" was a much better showcase for Parker Posey. That film had me laughing from start to finish and without rolling clichés in the plot.',\n",

Currently working in a temp job (where I am typing this review), \"Clockwatchers\" is terrifyingly familiar. It\\'s not a hilarious comedy, although it is quite funny. Certain moments threaten to veer into David Lynch-style self-conscious surrealism, but the director reigns these moments in, in the nick of time.<br /><br />It\\'s a film about small things happening in an enclosed space, and the friendships that grow between the most unlikely of people, due mostly to proximity. The mood of paranoia that emerges in the second half of the film is perfect - turning trivialities into monumental acts of anarchy and betrayal. The office becomes a sealed microcosm where the theft of a tiny plastic monkey becomes the end of the world.<br /><br />Not everyone is going to understand this film - it\\'s not \"Office Space\", which is more accessibly \\'wacky\\'. You\\'re not going to chuck it on with your mates and have a good laugh. It\\'s much more sombre and serious and ultimately quite sad. And it\\'s made me quit my job (so perhaps I should have given it 10 stars, just for that).',\n",
       " 'This was clearly written by someone who has gone through the mind numbing, soul snatching experience of being a temp. It captures the self-worthlessness perfectly and also the stupidity of modern corporate America today.',\n",
       " '\"Clockwatchers\" is a very funny little film that sheds light on the frustrations of spending eight hours a day in an entirely unexceptional environment where every action has been reduced to routine. The main characters are four women who entered the working world with hopes of making a life for themselves that would set them apart from the rest of the rat race, but had their dreams dashed when they realized that in today\\'s crowded job market they had to take what they could get. They ended up with desk space in a sterile, faceless office where they depend on their sense of humor and respect for one another to get through the day.<br /><br />This is a story that depends strongly on dialogue and character development to keep the viewer interested. It largely works, with a lot of amusing moments and sharp dialogue throughout, as well as keen observations about the humdrum existence too many of us lead. The always likeable Parker Posey has a terrific performance as the most rebellious and plainspoken of the group. There\\'s also Bob Balaban playing his usual fussy nebbish character, this time as a meticulous number cruncher who can\\'t let go of his pencils. In its second half, however, the story surrenders to the pessimism it tries to battle; the tone shifts from `Dilbert\\' to Kafka, and some of the characters suddenly become cold and unsympathetic. Nevertheless, it remains insightful and entertaining, something to which the average working stiff could relate.<br /><br />',\n",
       " \"I've been reading the comments and I'm not surprised that others find this movie boring. It's not for anyone with a limited attention span. I don't have one of those and I thought this was a very interesting, if not somewhat sad look at the world of employment whether it be temp or permanent. I guess everyone wants to fit in-whether it be your job or school. If you can find some little niche that you do belong in enjoy it because sometimes that fit never lasts. I think that's what happened in this movie. The 4 main characters fit in with each other because they were temps and had that little thing in common. But what else they had in common is not clear and I think it wasn't enough to hold the little group together. Sure, we can blame it on the thief plot but in the long run relationships like that don't last because they have very little in common. As for the new girl Cleo I actually felt sorry for her-she was such a lonely soul and it seemed she tried to make friends with those 4 but they didn't want to include her in. She paid Iris a compliment and also said hi but all she did was stare back at her-funny coming from those who complain about being ignored by the permanent workers because they were temps. She stole the things from everyone because it gave her a part of them since she didn't make friends with anyone.I can really feel for the Cleo character. The four main characters are a case study in themselves. But they were a hoot and so much like those that I've come across in life. And that's why I like this movie-the characters are real.\",\n",
       " \"I have been an office temp, and this portrays the way I felt all too well. As others have pointed out, it is more than a Dilbert spinoff, however. Sprecher does an excellent job of capturing the sense of floating and disconnectedness, to use Margaret's words, in modern society. We have a bittersweet, ironic story of an individual 'coming of age' as her group of friends breaks apart. Parker Posey's sassy and cynical character pulled me into this movie. Toni Collette at times could be mistaken for a less annoyingly neurotic Ally McBeal. Lisa Kudrow's role is familiar, yet tragic instead of comic. Alanna Ubach's character is less developed, as she seems to present an alternative -- she trades her current unhappiness for the traditional misery of a poor marriage.<br /><br />At the end Iris manipulates the barren work environment to her advantage. Perhaps there is hope for us after all.\",\n",
       " \"Transcendently beautiful in moments outside the office, it seems almost sitcom-like in those scenes. When Toni Colette walks out and ponders life silently, it's gorgeous.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to decide whether it's slapstick, farce, magical realism, or drama, but the best of it doesn't matter. (The worst is sort of tedious - like Office Space with less humor.)\",\n",
       " '\"Clockwatchers\" surprised me in many ways. At first I thought was just going to be a quirky comedy about resentful temps, I was wrong. There were many things in this satire that came unexpected. I was surprised with it\\'s meticulousness, every scene looks like it was arranged to resemble an office to the slightest details. You can strongly feel that dry and dead air, and the way everything seems to move without any change, in a monotonous pattern that will slowly but surely kill you\\'re personal energy. I never knew that an office could feel so oppressive, and this film portrays it was successful accuracy. Another thing that surprised me was the unexpected seriousness, I actually found myself thinking about some of the character\\'s observations on careers and goals, how sometimes we can totally lose our identity when all we try to do is to please others and maintain a decent salary. When \"Clockwatchers\" was over, I actually found myself depressed, and menaced by the possibility that my life could turn out like the characters\\'. But, bleak elements aside, this was also a pretty funny film as well. Parker Posey delivers a juicy performance, her pessimism never ceases to entertain. The other actresses are also good, and most of the scenes they share together are enjoyable to watch. The only thing that could of used some fixing was the film\\'s last half hour, it dragged on with the whole \"new girl\" plotline and the final conclusion was too vague to satisfy. But still, \"Clockwatcher\" is a good film, a unique blend of snappy humour and depressing accuracy that usually succeeds.',\n",

Frankly the words \"Lisa Kudrow\" and movie just make shudder, but a friend who\\'s taste in movies is just a bit different then my own suggested it so when I saw it playing on TMN I thought I\\'d watch it. The movie Office Space came to mind on more then on occasion while watching this. I do give Office Space a slightly higher rating, but the two movies are not that unalike in their styles. Both are subtle, intelligent comedies that challenge the viewer. I\\'ve said this about other movies and it applies here too, if you want to be spoon fed your laughs rent Ace Ventura. If you\\'ve ever sat in an Office with nothing to do for 8 hours, rent this movie (it only takes 2).',\n",
       " 'Evocative, funny look at four women stuck in temporary employment, and not all that thrilled at being there.

How they band together, then fall apart. It's ultimately a sad story with some hope for 2 of the characters. But it's as close to life as it gets.<br /><br />Wonderful performances by all 4 actresses. And small roles by some big character actors make this a good film.\",\n",
       " 'Finally, I got to see this legendary masterpiece on TV. When I first heard that there was an Arabian movie featuring the Western icon \"Hopalong Cassidy\"(William Boyd) and the Gothic icon Boris Karloff, the idea sounded like a disparate joke. (Actually, Karloff only plays a brief, minor role, being new to the silver screen at that time.) <br /><br />The script is very original. The shooting is excellent for the times. And the acting is so well done, you feel what the characters feel, and can easily read the actors\\' lips for practically every line. Unlike many silent-era films, you get the sensation that you are in this one.<br /><br />The comedy starts right from the opening scene, and I will describe it only to illustrate the unexpected silliness of William Boyd: He is in a night battle in World War I, and drops into a shell crater to avoid German gunfire. His 1st Sergeant, a bully and a brute whom he despises, had just fallen in before him, and is unconscious. Boyd tries to revive him until he sees who he is, and starts slinging mud on the Sergeant\\'s face. He revives and they immediately jump into a fistfight in the mud. When a flare illuminates the night sky, they look up and see the hole is surrounded with numerous Germans with bayonets. The enemy was having a time watching them fight each other! It is an eye opener to see the future Hopalong Cassidy in a real cut-up comedy role, back when he looked like a very young cross between Marlon Brando and Jack Haley.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the nitty-gritty reality in this film about POW\\'s of World War I, in an era when glossed-over heroics and reality-denial dominated war films. Moreover, there is often a timeless feeling, especially during the POW camp scenes, which gives the viewer a sense of closeness to the people of that era; and the understanding that people have at all times in history been, in their own way, \"modern.\"<br /><br />The dual-based plot, (survival and escape, and later a pursuit of romance), rolls steadily through ever-changing backgrounds. The factors of comedy, action, danger, and romance blend harmoniously throughout. The relationship between Boyd\\'s and Wolheim\\'s characters develop from utter hatred, to enduring animosity, to forced survival cooperation, to mild mutual suspiciousness, to amorous competition, to strong friendship.<br /><br />Though this is a silent film from 1927, centered on World War I in Europe and Turkey, I have never had such a modern and timeless feeling from a silent movie. This results from the cool, timeless acting and characterizations, and the excellent directing and shooting.<br /><br />This is the first silent drammatic film my kids have thoroughly enjoyed, (until now only preferring silent comedic standards by Keaton, Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd.)',\n",

They however are fighting with each other and working the nerve of one-an-other. They of course are caught, but after an inventive escape they are taken on a whirlwind adventure in Arabia, with all the humor you might find in an Abbott and Costello movie.

The film is the only recipient of the \"Best Direction of a Comedy Film\" Academy Award that was only given out in 1927-1928. William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are two feuding G.I.s that are both captured by the Germans in World War I. The film is more of an adventure/comedy rather than a straight comedy. They have a suspenseful escape from their prison camp, only to be recaptured and sent to Turkey. They end up being stuck on a train, and a ship, as well as well as being marked for death by an Arab suitor. A very young and beautiful Mary Astor is a veiled woman who boards the ship and is a target of romantic advances by both men. Look fast to spot a very young Boris Karloff as the ship purser.

Directed with verve by Lewis Milestone and greatly benefiting from William Cameron Menzies' art direction, the high jinks & high adventure of this antique buddy film are once again ready to delight the viewing audience.<br /><br />Clean-cut private William Boyd and plug-ugly sergeant Louis Wolheim battle Germans, Arabs and each other across Europe, the Mediterranean and into Palestine. They make a terrific comedy duo, constantly involved in one-upmanship and dangerous exploits whether in a POW camp, on a prisoner train, aboard a tramp steamer, or in a Moslem souk and emir's palace. Wolheim, with his hilariously expressive face, has a slight advantage in the scene stealing category, while Boyd has the upper hand in the romantics department.<br /><br />Mary Astor, as the endangered princess, is the willing recipient of Boyd's attentions. Her role doesn't give her a great deal to do except look lovely & alarmed, but these she carries off admirably.<br /><br />In the supporting cast, Michael Visaroff is the black hearted ship's captain who comes into conflict with Boyd & Wolheim; look fast for Boris Karloff as his purser. Dashing Ian Keith nicely plays the young Arab chieftain who will stop at nothing to make Astor his bride.<br /><br />At various points throughout the movie the viewer will notice the deterioration of the film stock, showing that TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS was indeed rescued, like the princess, just in time.\",\n",

The film depicts two soldiers fighting in the trenches of WWI and wearing gas masks against the Mustard Gas that the Germans were using to kill the American Forces in Europe. William Boyd,(Pvt W. Dangerfield Phelps),\"Hopalong Cassidy\",\\'49 TV Series, was a green horn to fighting in the muddy trenches and meets up with a veteran soldier, Louis Walheim,(Sgt.Peter McGaffney),\"The Sin Ship\",\\'31, who gave Pvt.

The two soldiers meet up with Mary Astor,(Anis bin Adham/Miraz),\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\',\\'64, who wears a veil over her face and charms the two soldiers into paying for her fare on their voyage. If you look real close, you will see Boris Karloff,(Purser)\"Targets\",\\'68, who was the purser on the ship and was just starting his career with a minor role in this Army life comedy, at the age of 40 years.

Of course, this entails a considerable degree of live type acting (similar to that seen in plays), but I did not get a feeling of melodrama like is all too common in most silent films and early sound movies.<br /><br />The most enjoyable performance is played by Louis Wolheim as the rough edged but colorful Sgt. Peter O'Gaffney, who was *perfectly* casted for the role; considering both appearance and skill.<br /><br />There were at least a few peculiar facts about Muslim society that I had previously learned over the past several years, which added to my appreciation of the story in the area of historical accuracy.<br /><br />My favorite scene was when the heroes are fleeing a swarm of dangerous, sword wielding Arabs through the narrow streets of a busy Muslim city. Suddenly though the chase is interrupted by an oblivious imam who pops out onto an exterior balcony to announce that it's time for afternoon prayer. Everyone out on the streets (except for the heroes) religiously obeys Islamic law and momentarily kneels down, which allows the heroes to escape. That scene was just one example of the film's many expressions of originality.<br /><br />After seeing this movie I better realize how extensively modern movies contain rehashed ideas that were pioneered decades earlier.\",\n",
       " 'The third movie produced by Howard Hughes, this gem was thought to be lost. It was recently restored and shown on TCM (12/15/04). The plot is a familiar one - two WW I soldiers escape from a German prison camp (guarded by an extremely lethargic German shepherd, who practically guides them out of the camp), stow away on a ship, and end up in \"Arabia\", where they rescue the lovely Mary Astor. The restoration is very good overall, although there are two or three very rough sequences. The production is very good, and there are some very funny scenes. And did I mention that Mary Astor is in it? The film won an Academy Award for the now-defunct category of \"Best Direction of a Comedy\".',\n",

This was still early in his career, but his use of inventive angles and a moving camera showed brilliance.<br /><br />Ian Keith made a superb suave villain in one of his best roles.<br /><br />Being a silent film, \"Two Arabian Knights\" probably won\\'t be shown even on Turner Classic Movies very often, but I urge film fans to grab any opportunity to watch it.',\n",
       " 'William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are the \"Two Arabian Knights\" referred to in the title, humorously. The pair start out as U.S. POWs trying to escape from the Germans during World War I. Eventually, they find themselves on board a ship bound for Arabia. While tripping out to the Middle East, they rescue an Arab woman, Mary Astor, who turns out to be a Princess; and, of course, becomes a romantic interest for the \"Two Arabian Knights\". No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms. Astor!<br /><br />The film is very well photographed and directed; Lewis Milestone has wonderful sets, and stages scenes beautifully. Of the performances, Mr. Wolheim stands out - he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak, trough the film is silent. The story isn\\'t as strong as it could be - there are some events and sequences which had me wondering how and why the characters\\' locale changed. The last looks, exchanged between one of the stars and an extra, is an example of something I didn\\'t understand. Perhaps these were comic bits which had a particular appeal for the time.<br /><br />The film is damaged in several places; but there is enough preserved, in even these scenes, to allow your mind to fill in the visual blanks. Boris Karloff appears as the \"Purser\"; watch for his big scene on ship, when Wolheim goes into a room with him for some money (what actually happens is a mystery). Early in the film, there is a long scene with a lot of naked men shown from the waist up (or, thereabouts); they are POWs being herded to the showers. Director Milestone uses parades of soldiers moving to great effect; this \"shower\" scene is different in that several of the men don\\'t look as Caucasian as you might expect - maybe not as many Caucasian men would agree to appear nude? <br /><br />******* Two Arabian Knights (9/23/27) Lewis Milestone ~ William Boyd, Louis Wolheim, Mary Astor',\n",

It\\'s the story of two American Army buddies, William Boyd (aka \"Hopalong Cassidy\") and Louis Wolheim, and their adventures as they manage to escape from a German prison camp during WWI. However, as this is a comedy, the duo manage to make the most round about and stupid escape--accidentally boarding a train to Constantinople to be placed in a Turkish prisoner of war camp! On the way, they manage to escape once again and end up in quite the adventure--meeting sexy Mary Astor along the way.<br /><br />As far as the film goes, it was a rather funny script and despite being a silly plot, it worked rather well. The chemistry between Boyd and Wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining. Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out Harold Lloyd\\'s film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it\\'s one of Lloyd\\'s best films). Still, it\\'s well worth a look--especially if you love silent films.<br /><br />By the way, director Milestone and Louis Walheim would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.',\n",

I did like the lead actors, but thought little of the film.<br /><br />One intriguing sequence. Early on, the guys are supposed to get \"de-loused\" and for about three minutes, fully dressed, do some schtick.

Robin Williams as Armand is the only actor who is playing his role somewhat close to satisfactory. He can\\'t quite match the charm and manners of Ugo Tognazzi, though. But Nathan Lane as Albert is a disaster. You can clearly see that he is a man occasionally trying to play a gay person. It\\'s all in the makeup and even that does not always help. When he is rehearsing a song you can\\'t tell he\\'s gay at all. But if you look at Michel Serrault\\'s original performance, it\\'s nothing short of outstanding. Every movement, every expression tells you that he\\'s a woman in man\\'s body. Basically, a witty script and superb actors\\' play make me watch the 1978 \"La Cage Aux Folles\" original over and over, while bland adaptation with weak acting of \"The Birdcage\" spoils the brilliant script. I have no clue what was the point in making this remake. Replace french lawmaker with a senator? Just go get the original. Then you can watch this remake and see if you agree with me.

What would happen if the daughter of a Republican Senator who was part of some sort of conservative coalition was marrying a man who\\'s father is gay and lives with a cross dressing diva. That\\'s the setup of The Birdcage, an Americanized version of the French film La Cage Aux Folles, and becomes a fun look at how some members of the gay community have to try to straighten themselves out in the right circumstances, and how difficult that really is. Robin Williams plays Armand Goldman, a Jewish gay man who had a one-night stand with Christine Baranski (he just wanted to know what all the fuss was about) and had a son, Val (played by Dan Futterman). Futterman\\'s performance is a highlight in the movie, an understated, confused role that carries the sanity in the movie. Armand lives with Albert, who\\'s stage name is \"Starina,\" played perfectly by Nathan Lane. The shrieks, the clothes, so much over the top comes from Lane\\'s character that it\\'s hard not to laugh. Val comes home, as he\\'s about to marry his girlfriend of I guess 45 minutes, both are extremely young, played by Calista Flockhart, before her Ally McBeal days. Her father is the conservative Senator, played with a self-important whimsy by Gene Hackman. The problems come from the big dinner where the parents finally meet, and the real mom is late. This means Albert needs to become Val\\'s mother, and we find out all of that cross dressing was worth it. The manic action that takes place when they try to first turn Albert straight, then as a woman carries the movie. It is all setup through the first half of the film. The second half has all of the comedic fireworks and is what makes the film memorable. That, and Hank Azaria\\'s character Spartacus, a flamboyant Greek housekeeper for Armand and Albert. Azaria has said he used his grandmother as a model for this role, and it shows through. Little jokes are what make the movie, so keep you ears open, and your toast un-pierced.',\n",

And, the exploration of all forms of desire among a group of \"not so young\" patrons. The concept that even at this age, people can still maintain, grow and explore all forms of sensuality and sexuality is very appealing - kind of makes me feel that there is sex after 50!

       " \"A sparkling, incisive, progressive-minded comedy-drama that leaves much of this genre looking exactly like the disguised condoning of tradition it really is. One can only begin to imagine how entrenched thinkers in Korean society would react to this honest, observant, level-headed look at four late-twenty-somethings for whom life provides obstacles in both career and love that neither regressive-collective cultural thinking nor parents - who barely figure into the plot - can solve. Nan (Chang Jin-young), is a wide-eyed fashion industry drone busted down to Chilli's manager by her sexist middle manager. The shift stings, but also points out realities she's not entirely uncomfortable with. Into her world comes Seo- hoon (Kim Ju-hyeok) a decent-fella securities trader who clearly wants to pursue a relationship despite her reservations. Meanwhile, her best friend Dong Mi (Uhm Jeong-hwa), a web company employee out of work thanks to her own sexist superior, shares a flat with old pal Joon (Lee Beom-soo, in a 180 degree turn from his creepy role in OH! Brothers), who's as unsuccessful at removing himself from bad relationships as she is successful at bringing home a long string of bad boyfriends. That both of these couples should end up together is a given. That the film provides no easy resolutions yet plenty of optimism for these truly modern Korean women is the year's most pleasant K-cinema surprise: it allows the protagonists an honesty and resolve in deciding their own fates that many recent K- comedies seem hell-bent on denying similar characters. Here, marriage to a handsome man and financial success - long the expectations of many young Korean women - are not depicted as an absolute guarantee of security and/or happiness, and turning 30 without being defined is hardly the end of the world, particularly for Korean women who remain adaptable to the changes happening around them, rather than being pressured to fit a mold as their ancestors were. Fine acting across the board, anchored by Chang's captivating, believable performance, raises this far above the low-brow antics too often seen in these kinds of films (CRAZY FIRST LOVE immediately comes to mind). Almost needless to say, but the production design and cinematography are sterling, with warm and inviting environments (including an absolutely gorgeous Seoul) a veritable extension of the optimism with which these characters ultimately face their uncertain future. Must-see contemporary Korean cinema, and easily one against which all similar Korean romantic films should be measured. 10.\",\n",

I would even consider this film to be a great painting of the common people. A lot of films take the escapist approach to deviate its content from real life; in my opinion that is a perfectly legitimate way to make films, and while Singles certainly has its share of over-the-top moments (which are highly enjoyable), I found it to resemble life more than most genre films.

For any movie, to me, keeping your interest is the mark for a good movie and this movie hits that mark.\",\n",
       " '1 GIANT LEAP play this video Director: Jamie Catto Director: Duncan Bridgeman<br /><br />It is increasingly rare to come across a project that genuinely defies description, where no pigeonhole will do.<br /><br />The members of 1 Giant Leap, while pushing the cutting-edge technology of the 21st century to its limit and utilizing their own fierce intelligence and consummate musicality plus a list of collaborators ranging from Michael Stipe to Kurt Vonnegut, Asha Bhosle to Dennis Hopper, have done just that.<br /><br />Others taking part include Stewart Copeland, Brian Eno, Baaba Maal, Tom Robbins, Maxi Jazz from Faithless, Neneh Cherry, The Mahotella Queens, Speech from Arrested Development, Andy Summers, Eddi Reader and Linton Kwezi Johnson.<br /><br />1 Giant Leap are Jamie Catto and Duncan Bridgeman, who first met at a mutual friend\\'s flat in Brighton and found that they shared a deep love for two universally influential albums: David Byrne and Brian Eno\\'s My Life in the Bush of Ghosts and Peter Gabriel\\'s Passion, the soundtrack to Martin Scorsese\\'s The Last Temptation of Christ. They talked about music, technology, travel, the universe and their mutual dream of travelling the world, recording and filming as many of their heroes from the areas of music, art, science, literature and philosophy as they could find, seeking out the unity in the diversity. Luckily Palm Pictures boss Chris Blackwell shared their vision and offered them a contract.<br /><br />Catto and Bridgeman did not draw their impressive list of collaborators from their personal address books; rather, they were forced to became \"world champion cold callers.\" Dennis Hopper was so enthused by the project that he immediately got on the phone with Harvey Keitel and Meryl Streep to get them involved.<br /><br />1 Giant Leap is a unique project for the 21st century which fuses words, sounds, rhythms and images from across the globe to celebrate the creative diversity of musicians, storytellers, authors, filmmakers, artists and thinkers from cultures around the world. The results illustrate breathtaking artistic and cultural diversity with a clear message of unity running throughout.<br /><br />This project is the first of its kind, both in its immense terms of reference and its revolutionary use of cutting-edge technology. Having taken their backing tracks with them, the musicians were able to not only collaborate on 1 Giant Leap songs, but also to hear the sounds previous collaborators had been inspired to lay down. For instance, a sarangi player in india could play to the grooves laid down a week earlier by Ugandan drummers. Thus each track grew and developed as the duo circled the globe.<br /><br />Catto and Bridgeman\\'s adventures served as the basis for their 12-chapter film and accompanying album. Each film chapter corresponds to a track on the album, exploring themes such as \"Masks and Roles,\" \"Death and Change,\" \"Freedom and Innocence,\" and \"The Shadow and Inspiration.\" Containing footage from the streets of New York to the jungles of Ghana, the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Rajsthan, 1 Giant Leap represents is a completely new genre of filmmaking somewhere between documentary and pop video, a music-based time capsule of the planet earth at the turn of the 21st century.<br /><br />About the the members: Jamie Catto: musician, film director, editor, photographer and creative catalyst<br /><br />As founder member and art director of the hugely successful dance-pop group Faithless, Catto has enjoyed no fewer than five top ten singles in the U.K., watching two albums go gold and enjoying enormous success around the world playing to crowds of up to 80, 000 fans. In the role of art director for Faithless\\' cheeky label, Catto has directed videos for all their artists -- each of them to huge critical acclaim -- including the group\\'s stunning sign language film for \"God Is a DJ.\" His photos and designs have also adorned the covers of Skinny\\'s Failure and Faithless\\' Sunday 8pm.<br /><br />Duncan Bridgeman: artist, producer, multi-instrumentalist<br /><br />',\n",

Two British film makers traveled to 25 countries recording pieces of music and then fusing them together via laptop, and the results are a stunning fusion of world musics and editing.

       " 'Wow... I don\\'t know whether to love Sadako or fear her. \"Ring 0\" completes the trilogy and makes it into an epic. We delve into the complicated and frightening (yet very tragic) character that is Sadako Yamamura. Like \"Ring 2\", this film continues the enrichment of the Ring mythos. We watch the frightening, tragic story of Sadako unfold before our eyes. We discover a more human Sadako... one that feels love and compassion in spite of her peculiarities, and we are once again frightened as we were in the previous movies. In a way, the terror is more effective here than in \"Ring 2\" even in light of a movie that feels more like a tear-jerking drama at times than like a horror film. This is a must-see for fans of the first two movies. Watch it. You won\\'t be sorry.. even if some of the introduced story elements seem a little strange. They are carried out beautifully! Sadako herself is beautiful and enchanting.<br /><br />I\\'ll conclude with one final statement: If you thought a staggering, ghostly Sadako was intimidating, wait until you see her when she\\'s alive and kicking, and more powerful than she ever was as an ethereal presence. Now she has the ability to kill at will rather than with a cursed videotape!<br /><br />Hmm.. do I sound like I\\'m contradicting myself about Sadako? I\\'m not going to explain myself. Just watch the movie and see for yourselves!',\n",
       " 'After the disappointment of a still decent \"Ring 2\", \"Ring 0 : Birthday\" is a return to form. Yukie Nakamo does a wonderful job of portraying the tragic final days of Sadako\\'s attempt at a normal life. The sweet, innocent side of her was never suspected when I first glimpsed the malevolent presence of Sadako in the first installment. Yukie is very moving in her portrayal and evokes sympathy and empathy for the character. Similarily, Daisuke Ban gives a opens up the character of Dr Ikuma from the glimpses we\\'ve seen in previous installments. Here we see a tortured and resigned man who genuinely loves Sadako as a daughter, but can\\'t escape from the knowledge of how dangerous she is and the steps he may have to take to prevent her harming others.<br /><br />Despite the main love story and drama of Sadako\\'s attempt at a normal life, there are still plenty of creepy moments and supernatural happenings. The scenes with the school teacher relating her experiences of teaching a young Sadako are genuinely intriguing and eerie. Indeed the story of the kids swimming in the sea and Sadako\\'s prediction of their fate, is truly gripping, despite nothing actually being shown. The excitng scenes in the woods and cabin show how deadly Sadako can be when her evil side has control. The weird appearance and way of walking from the first \"Ring\" is seen again here and there\\'s some great bonesnapping moments when Sadako hunts down her final prey. These scenes and the conclusion give \"Ring 0 : Birthday\" the standout sequences that \"Ring 2\" never quite managed to sustain from the original film.<br /><br />Some of the plot points do bear a resemblance to \"Carrie\" but the film handles them in a different way. The story, although slow paced is always enthralling (a hallmark of the \"Ring\" series to date) and it seems poor Sadako never really had a chance from what awaited her. Aligned against her are: an inability to control the dark powers of her alter ego, a creepy director who learns of her secret and wishes to use her, a reporter with a grudge and a suspicious and unfriendly acting troupe who never seem to have made any real attempt at welcoming the shy, withdrawn girl into their fold. Mob paranoia and fear contribute to Sadako\\'s fate and make her the malevolent presence she is today. As the film reaches it\\'s conclusion, you can\\'t help but wish that things could end differently for the unfortunate lovers but anyone who\\'s seen the previous installments, knows that there\\'s only one place this prequel can end. The last few minutes of the film are heartbreaking and the film\\'s end credit song beautifully encapsulates the finality of Sadako\\'s backstory. <br /><br />Don\\'t expect too many absolute answers here though. \"Ring 0 : Birthday\" maintains the mystery and ambiguity of the first two films and once again, imagination is a required element from the viewer. If you enjoyed the previous films and want to see more of Sadako, this film will give you quite a thrill ride. Whether it\\'s poignant doomed love story, another part of the Ring puzzle or an eerie and haunting Japanese ghost story, \"Ring 0 : Birthday\" is a winner on every level.',\n",
       " \"Combining elements of drama and horror, Ring 0 is a very worthy installation of the indie horror franchise. This film really starts, though, as a drama, telling us the story of Sadako in a very linear fashion (which, deliciously, has become the more difficult and confusing path to take, since we already know the end of the story). We see Sadako as a human (!) who is not scary or evil at all but actually seems rather pleasant and almost painfully shy. A while later in the film, we see that Sadako is actually warring desperately with herself . . . and is losing. Her eventual slide into the monstrosity of the first and second Ring films is a sight to behold (and, hardcore fans will note, is echoed by a similar fall of Ando Mitsuo in the less popular Rasen).<br /><br />The social overtones of this film are also outstanding and a fine addition to the series. Whereas the first two films are more exercises in combining psychological terror with techno-horror, Ring 0 takes a more Romero-esque approach to the social aspect of Sadako's transformation, meditating on the cruelty of her peers and the burning need for revenge of one journalist that brings the whole tragedy crashing down.<br /><br />Incidentally, although it takes some time, this film WILL scare the hell out of you at the end. Just wait for it.<br /><br />Very, very good. See it.\",\n",
       " 'A great prequel to the Ringu series. In this film we see the human side of Sadako before her death & the cruel attitude of others towards her. By the end of the film you feel sorry for Sadako & not her victims. I enjoyed this more than the original film, in many ways this film follows a more traditional story structure than the original.',\n",
       " \"Ring0 is haunting and beautiful. It's definatly the most seriously dramatic and passionate of the ring films. Saadako is represented as a person here with a dark side. But also a wanting side that wants to be forgiven and accepted and most importantly loved for her uncontrollable actions. Their are strong performances and the a vivid and secret spouting storyline that makes you look at each film completely different. In an age of mindless sequels Ring 0 is a perfect film. It balances horror with beauty and love with hate. The film is as much a tear jerker as a screamer. And the true story of what happened will stay with you!\",\n",
       " \"I can't work out why people didn't enjoy this movie, i thought it was one of the best movies i have ever seen. Compared the the other Ring (Ringu) movies it is not as scary but kind of upsetting, and like the other Ring movies has a great *i have to see more* kinda ending. I actually felt sorry for Sadako in this movie, the same way i felt sorry for Carrie White in Carrie. Also this movie, unlike Ring 2, has a completely new storyline to it, i also thought Yukie Nakama who played Sadako was totally awesome, her acting was just brilliant. The acting from the whole cast was just fantastic. So please try to see this movie, its well worth it, almost as good as the first Ringu!\",\n",
       " \"Ring and Ring 2's ability to terrify an audience relied strongly on the fact that the TV you were watching them on was a possible portal for the video-curse and even Sadako herself. Not that anyone would really believe Sadako would come out of your TV, but subconsciously it must have an effect. In Ring 0 - Birthday, there are no cursed videos and no televisions. Instead, '0' takes us back 30 years before the original Ring, to where Sadako is an apprentice for a theatre company. What we quickly learn is that Sadako is not a monstrous psychic-killer that springs from household appliances but a shy, troubled young woman with a secret past. Those familiar with the Ring films will know that Sadako 'killed' a mocking reporter at her mother's para-psychological demonstration after he accused the psychic of being a fraud. The fiancé of this reporter sets about investigating what went on and tracks down Sadako at the theatre, convinced that she is responsible in some way for her fiancé's death.<br /><br />The theatre troupe has a bad feeling about Sadako, as most of them have been experiencing the same disturbing dream about her, where they see her next to a well, and a certain air of doom has clouded the theatre since her arrival. When the lead actress in the play dies, killed by a younger Sadako (who is more like the ghoul from the first two films - it's confusing, but things are explained later), Sadako is given her role, much to the distress and suspicion of her fellow actors. The appearance of the 'dark' Sadako coincides with a strange noise played from a reel-to-reel tape recorder used by the theatre to play music. This, it seems, is how Sadako's dark power is unleashed, much like the videotape of the originals. But the older Sadako does not initiate any of the terror unleashed, and it is only a matter of time before the troupe accuses her of being a killer, whereas in reality she possesses the power to heal. Questions arise throughout the film, and are frequently answered, like why are two Sadako's, of different ages, walking around in the theatre? Yes, this question is answered, but not here in this review. Ring 0 is much more character based than the two previous films, getting into the head of the tragic Sadako by means of flashbacks and a subtle love story that shows she is a decent, vulnerable human being. At first it is slightly confusing as you are not sure whether you are watching the Sadako that will turn into the deformed, freakish ghoul that crawls out of TV screens to scare people to death. But it is knowing who she ends up to be that gives the film an air of tragedy as this misunderstood and innocent girl is hunted like a beast and forced to become one with her evil side. To say any more about the story would inevitably spoil it so I'll go no further, but for those worried about a lack of an 'evil' Sadako, don't worry. She's there too.<br /><br />Visually, Ring 0 is a much more lavish, expensive-looking production than its predecessors that relied on dark, gritty camera-work and realistic lighting to enhance the 'normal' and make the story more believable. With '0' the style is more polished, with swooping camera moves and clearer, more stylised lighting. This works, as the film is more layered than Ring, whose visuals suited its single-minded determination to scare you witless. Instead here we have a production just as interested in characterisation and story whilst also being very, very scary in places, which is helped by the excellent photography and set design.<br /><br />The acting is first rate, especially from Yukie Nakama who gives a subtle performance as Sadako, and everyone else is on form. The only let down is some of the terrible screaming going on here - remember the castle of 'Aaarrrrggggghhhhhh' from Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Well, people die whilst omitting these terrible, comedy death-groans that really do steal from the tension and give you a mental picture of Graham Chapman in chain mail. Apart from that, I don't think '0' could be a better film.<br /><br />Director Norio Tsuruta delivers a consistent, suspenseful shocker with plenty of visual flourishes and interesting ideas. It's easy to think that, in the wrong hands, Sadako could have been turned into a Freddy/Jason-style stalker walking amongst the shadows willing people to death, but instead we have an entertaining character piece with plenty of frights and chills spliced in for good measure.<br /><br />Ring 0 surprised me. It is a more solid film than the original, more layered and ultimately more rewarding. But what it lacks is the pure, raw fear of the original that made it so memorable, and it wouldn't work without seeing the original first. Better and scarier than 2, quite possibly on a par with the first. And if you thought Sadako couldn't be scarier than when she crawled out of the TV in Ring, sit tight - because Sadako's still got a few tricks up her elongated sleeve, including a finale that will have people of a nervous disposition reaching for the 'off' button on their remote control.<br /><br />If you're a Ring fan, you've got to see this. If you've never seen them you won't get it. If you've seen them and didn't like them, still give this one a try as it's a completely different experience altogether.\",\n",
       " \"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br /><br />If you enjoy true atmosphere in films, that creeping feeling of dread usually reserved for coming face to face with your own personal phobia, then watch this and prepare yourself- the final 15 minutes may well be the most heart-stoppingly chilling 15 minutes you will ever witness.<br /><br />Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than Ringu, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere. But my problem was that i was watching it and comparing it to Ringu in my mind. The last few scenes changed my mind. The next time i watched it my mind was clear, and it scared the s*it out of me. The few scary moments before the final scenes are pretty good, employing 'should i look behind me'? techniques much like the previous films, but before i get to the final scenes, i'll explain everything else.<br /><br />The film begins in modern day Japan- someone has heard a rumour about a videotape with a curse... then we flashback 30 years or so and meet the Evil Spirit Sadako...only to find she is a beautiful young woman, a talented actress though shy, and misunderstood. Sadako Yamamura is part of an acting school, and her first role is a few days away. She keeps to herself, but the attentions of Toyama infuriate the other girls, who can't understand what he sees in her when he could have any of them. The girls get jealous, and a number of deaths occur mysteriously. The story also follows a journalist who has traced down Sadako, she is the widow of a man who died, also under mysterious circumstances at the hands of, she believes, Sadako's estranged mother. Sadako's mother was famed for her supposed supernatural abilities, and killed herself a short while ago. The journalist wants to find out the truth, and finds Sadako just before opening night. Paying one of the jealous girls to mess with the audio equipment, hoping to get a reaction from Sadako, much like Hamlet, the play begins to go wrong, and in a Carrie-like scene, everyone blames Sadako. Then the fun really begins...<br /><br />Up to this point, the film is equal parts chilling, beautiful, and to a certain extent confusing. The acting has been very good from everyone, especially Yukie Nakama, who is gorgeous, and drags out our sympathy. Toyama is the only person who trusts Sadako, and tries to defend her, eventually leading to one of the most tragic scenes in movie history. That may sound like an over-statement, but if you have followed the movies, especially this one, intently, you will understand. Every scene is shot trying to balance beauty with the creation of fear, a wonderful irony considering Sadako's own birth and life- She doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is capable of great beauty, but all she seems to do is scare and kill.<br /><br />I've probably hyped the film too much now, but the final scenes in the forest and Sadako's old home are really that good. Terrifying, and directed brilliantly- watch for the way the forest suddenly changes colour from green and full of life, to that Sepia tinge used in the first films to show both the past and the afterlife. And watch in the background for a long haired figure in white floating past the trees. One of the most underrated horror movies of recent years, mainly because it can seem confusing at first glance, and because very few questions are actually answered. The point is, the questions are there to be asked, for us to work them out ourselves- we become like the journalists in each of the movies, drawing ourselves closer into the tragedy and threat of Sadako's life until we cannot escape. How long have i been typing for? You see? It worked. 9 out of 10\",\n",
       " 'Shortly after an oddly quiet young woman, Sadako Yamamura (Yukie Nakama), joins a drama troupe, strange events, including deaths with suspicious circumstances, start occurring. Is Sadako somehow connected to these events? And what does it have to do with a reporter investigating a years-old tragedy at a psychic demonstration? <br /><br />Series Note: There are many different films, television series, books, comic books, etc. based on the \"Ring Universe\", and it\\'s very complicated trying to sort them out. The Japanese films known as \"Ring\" or \"Ringu\" can be numbered 0 (this one), 1 (Ringu, 1998) and 2 (Ringu 2, 1999), and function well as a self-contained story. This film, Ring 0: Birthday is a prequel. I prefer watching it first, but if you want more mystery in the other films, watch them in their release order: Ringu, Ringu 2, then Ringu 0. Note that there is also a Japanese film named Rasen (aka Spiral, 1998) which was meant to be a \"Ring 2\", but that was later superseded with the 1999 Ringu 2. Rasen is supposedly closer to the second Ring novel, but 1999\\'s Ringu 2 is seen as more or less the \"official\" Ringu sequel.<br /><br />There is an infamous mock commercial from the early days of \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975) about a product named \"Shimmer\". Shimmer was notable for being both a floor wax and a dessert topping. Ring 0 has Sadako as a Shimmer-like entity. Only, instead of being just two kinds of things, she\\'s six--a telekinetic, a psychic, a precognizant, a ghost, a psychic healer, and a physical manifestation of a split personality. The film overall has a Shimmer-like quality, too. It\\'s both a horror film and a slow, realistic drama with romance overtones. The horror stuff generally works, although Sadako would have benefited from not having so many functions. The more serious dramatic sections, which take up almost an hour of this 90-minute film, are not quite as successful.<br /><br />The script, by Hiroshi Takahashi, from a story by Ring novelist Koji Suzuki, is admirable on an artistic level. Takahashi is fond of parallelism, setting up the drama troupe\\'s rehearsals and performance as an innocuous veil that often matches more sinister events beneath the surface. He frequently changes our perspective so that we see a stage performer scream, say, at the same time someone offstage should be screaming. These kinds of parallels can be found throughout the film.<br /><br />The problem is that director Norio Tsuruta just cannot get much momentum going with the material. The dramatic rehearsals and backstage bickering that take up a large percentage of screen-time just aren\\'t that eventful or exciting. There are glimpses, through Sadako or around her, of a more intriguing world, but they\\'re often little more than \"flashes\" that might cause us to do a double take. Takahashi and Tsuruta work hard to establish a romance subplot involving a love triangle (or two), but this can barely get off the ground. It often feels superfluous.<br /><br />The best material featuring Sadako in the earlier part of the film resembles something of a cross between a Hitchcockian thriller and Brian De Palma\\'s Carrie (1976). But those are overly generous comparisons, since at least the first hour of Ring 0 has little of the suspense, style or directorial panache of either.<br /><br />I would have preferred a stronger focus on Shoko Miyaji (Yoshiko Tanaka), the reporter who is trying to investigate the psychic demonstration tragedy. Her scenes, which tend to have the flavor of a police procedural with slight horror twinges, are entertaining, and a larger focus on her would have broken up play rehearsal scenes better. It would have also given the character more weight for the climax, which would have given the ending even greater impact.<br /><br />As it stands, the last half hour is still the best part. We finally unravel much of the mystery behind Sadako (although there are a lot of questions that could still be answered), and gain insight into some of the events and comments in the first two-thirds of the film, which otherwise can seem cryptic (it pays to rewatch the first hour after the film is over--I enjoyed it more the second time). <br /><br />There are a number of events during the climax that are breathtaking in their brutality, all nicely scripted and directed. One of these, when two characters are enigmatically killed off-screen, is a rare example of an \"attack scene\" where I agree that what you\\'re not shown can be more effective than what you are shown. We get to see the event leading right up to the death, and we see the bloody aftermath. Filming how it happened would have drained much of its mystique. Another outstanding development in the climax is rooted in the relationship between two characters, and works so well because of strong cultural taboos.<br /><br />While it\\'s probably my least favorite Ring-related film, Ring 0 is worth viewing because of its place in the series and the excellent climax.',\n",
       " 'The original \"Ringu\" (1998) is a truly creepy, modern-day Japanese horror classic; its sequel, \"Ringu 2\" (1999), is a sometimes confusing anticlimax of sorts, but still quite fun, nevertheless. And in \"Ringu 0\" (2000), the prequel to the original, we get to see the face of Sadako Yamamura, heretofore mostly hidden behind long, stringy hair, and, as played by actress Yukie Nakama, it is quite a lovely face indeed. We also get to discover some of Sadako\\'s back story, and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape. We see her as a woman of around 20, an aspiring actress in a dramatic troupe, and all seems to go well with her, until her otherworldly powers begin to manifest themselves, and her fellow thespians start to drop faster than victims of tsutsugamushi disease. Compared to Carrie White in the 1976 film \"Carrie,\" Sadako is far nastier, and just like in that earlier film, all heck breaks loose following an instigated public freakout. \"Ringu 0\" is a fairly slow-moving film, and a surprise revelation concerning Sadako that comes halfway through is very hard to swallow. But since it effectively doubles the Sadako quotient, why quibble? Sadako is certainly a fascinating character, and the film\\'s final 1/2 hour does repay the slow buildup. Coming full circle (closing the ring?), the film culminates with the terrible act of attempted murder that we partially witnessed in the original \"Ringu,\" and fans of the series will perhaps understand me when I say that, um, all\\'s well that ends well!',\n",
       " \"Ringu 0 fills in a few of the blanks in the Ringu series, like, for starters, why she was shunned and how she came to be in the well. Young Sadako is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet. There are glimpses of Sadako's strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she's threatened. There are snippets here and there about her mother and her father, and her childhood, and it all eventually leads up to the Sadako that we all know and love, the one in the well. Now, she's also cast as an understudy (or as they call it here, apprentice) in a play, and somehow the star dies, horribly, while sitting right there in the midst of her fellow actors. Sadako then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and Sadako's telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself. After this point the film takes off but I'll leave that to you to find out what happens, if you like. Not the best of this series that I've seen but good for filling in a few blanks here & there. 7 out of 10.\",\n",
       " \"This is a prequel which actually works and explains things rather than giving even more questions. You can argue weather the mystery of Sadako is better left untouched, but the fact still remains; this is a good movie.<br /><br />The lead (Yukie Nakama as a shy Sadako) is very good, even though it's obvious she's a Japanese version of Carrie White; misunderstood, creepy and with gifts she never wanted. That's the only real problem with this movie; the original ring movie was just that; original. This movie however, get's inspiration from other sources, such as Carrie, and that removes some of it's power.<br /><br />While it's not as moody as Ring, Ring 0 still has some very good horror scenes and some smart camera-work. Seeing a white shape just at the edge of the screen is much more effective than, for example, the killer's POV.<br /><br />As with Ring, this is a bit slow but builds up to a good finale. There are no special effects really, and it's very down-to-earth, one of the qualities of this and Ring.<br /><br />Finally, there's the fact that it's Japanese. There's something refreshing about seeing a movie in a different language, in different environments, in a different culture.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to those who liked Ring. It's definitely a worthy prequel. 7/10\",\n",
       " 'Since this movie is an adaptation of Mr. Koji Suzuki\\'s Lemonheart which is among the 3 stories contained in Ringu 0: Baasudei that was released in 1999, it\\'s sufficient say that the director did pretty well with altering some of its contents to suit the interpretation of the previous movies (Ringu and Ringu 2) which was also unparalleled. I don\\'t think the storyline was confusing at all since it mostly concentrated on Sadako\\'s life (Derived from Lemonheart) and doesn\\'t really focus on the curse of the video tape. I think it depends on \"how well\" you understand this movie that will determine how much you appreciate it or not. Since I took the time to search for an informative website that clarified some of the scenes from the movie, I\\'ve accrued better understanding of the story and respect for it.<br /><br />What I truly love about this movie is the fact that they wanted us to feel sympathetic towards Sadako\\'s character albeit the wickedness of what we see in Ringu and Ringu 2. Bravo to Yukie Nakama for portraying Sadako\\'s character effectively. She\\'s one of those few actresses that can truly set your emotions rising and falling from within. It\\'s designed to tell us the tragic story of Sadako\\'s life before the cursed video tape, which exceeded from my own expectations. That is what makes it unique from the previous movies. It\\'s dramatic atmosphere haunted me and made me justify why such a character would turn out to be malevolent in Ringu.<br /><br />I can see why many are baffled by the story since the one who directed this is not Nakata Hideo and obviously lingered a bit from the previous adaptations (I guess you might say more on the book than Ringu and Ringu 2.).<br /><br />My verdict: 10/10***',\n",
       " \"Ring 0 is the Japanese prequel to the Ring Mythos.<br /><br />Where Sadako Yamamura is early in her college experience, and dealing with the typical issues of trying to succeed in her love for theater, and her romantic life. She is cursed, and is generally unaware when this seemingly multiple personality takes over her being, in this Shakespearean tragedy of a film that leaves one wishing it could have ended differently.<br /><br />Truly a masterpiece which inspired me to submit a sort of comical comic strip parody to a Ring 0 art contest last year, where I won third place, which was pretty exciting.

       " 'In Jôji Iida\\'s \"Rasen\", Sadako explained that the reason behind her curse towards unfortunates was for others to experience pure fear, the same kind of fear she went through all alone at the bottom of a darkened well. <br /><br />In Norio Tsuruta\\'s \"Bâsudei\", the \"Sadako\" series continues, except this time we follow a young woman, named Sadako(Yukie Nakama), haunted by a ghoulish alter ego with considerable power. Sadako is an apprentice for a theatrical troupe preparing in rehearsals for a play, alienated by the actors and crew who feel intimidated and uneasy around her. A sound effects engineer, Hiroshi Tôyama(Seiichi Tanabe), seems to be the only one who accepts her without contention, actually encouraging once she receives the leading role after the actress dies under suspicious, and very unusual, circumstances. The troupe and crew soon come to the understanding, thanks to a news reporter who instigates a lynch mob after the director(..who initiates a traumatic situation, accusing Sadako, an actress he put in position to become a star, of killing the lead actress)is found murdered, his body discovered by a stage hand, that they are accursed(..her photographer\\'s snapshots reveal their distorted faces and other disturbing images). It seems that the entire troupe is cursed by the malevolent doppelganger of Sadako, and they will take matters into their own hands in order to protect themselves from the same fate as the director and lead actress, securing the wrath of an evil they\\'ll wish they never offended. <br /><br />A different approach to the \"Ringu\" series this time making Sadako a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul. The ghoul is, in a sense, Sadako\\'s \"protector\", a kind of spectre that haunts the theater, and we see how the troupe and crew always respond to our heroine with disdain and disregard. Sadako, right from the start, is treated as a derelict, placed on an island because she sends off \"spook signals\" to everyone. Tôyama becomes her sole friend and confident and their blossoming romance is the heart and soul of \"Ringu 0-Birthday\", as he attempts to rescue her from all those that find Sadako a threat..to no avail. We see how the reporter finds Sadako, understanding her past(..including Sadako\\'s relationship to a psychiatrist named Ikuma, portrayed by Daisuke Ban, who had disappeared after being excommunicated by his colleagues and peers), with designs on destroying her life. \"Bâsudei\" actually has two major climaxes, the theatrical production which spirals out of control when it should\\'ve been Sadako\\'s finest hour on stage, and the discovery of where Ikuma had been hiding the alter ego, the lynch mob, behind an attack on our heroine, coming in contact, face-to-face with a fate worse than death. Potent finale, reiterating what I mentioned in the opening sentence of my user comment, as we witness Ikuma\\'s decision to \"end all of it\" in regards to Sadako. The well, as always, returns, an ominous presence acknowledging an act of betrayal, a symbol of fear, which has fueled countless miseries, lives lost thanks in part to how it was used to get rid of a \"bad seed.\"',\n",
       " 'This is a quite good and interesting prequel to the Japanese Ringu series. It perhaps its not necessarily good as a part of the Ringu series but as a stand alone movie it simply is a really great one.<br /><br />This movie focuses on how Sadako becomes the murdering spirit. It sounds like a bad idea to give the \\'monster\\' a face and a backdrop story and yes, this is perhaps also why \"Ringu 0: Bâsudei\" is perhaps not that great as a part of the Ringu series. This movie is also less horror like and orientated as any other movie out of the series and it focuses more on the dramatic aspects of the Sadako character. It\\'s not her fault that she is the way she is and she actually is a cute and shy person. This sort of ruins the image of the evil Sadako spirit we know from the other Ringu movies. In that regard this movie suffers from the same problem as \"Hannibal Rising\". It gives the monster a face and because of that we loose some of our respect for the character and it ruins his original image. For instance I never saw Sadako as a young adult but more as a 12 year old child or so. In this movie she is presented as a young woman.<br /><br />But like I said, it can\\'t be denied that as a standalone movie this is simply a great one to watch. It\\'s nicely directed with a good overall visual style and it has a good compelling story, that mixes drama with some more supernatural elements. You can see this movie as \"Ringu\" meets \"Carrie\", since this movie story- and character-wise definitely show some similarities to the Brian De Palma horror classic \"Carrie\", from 1976.<br /><br />The movie doesn\\'t always have a too fast pace and there is not always a lot happening within the movie. The first hour of the movie or so even feels quite redundant afterward. It isn\\'t until very well halve way through that the movie starts to take off. It\\'s also then that the movie its horror elements really start to kick in and the Sadako character starts to become the evil spirit we all know from the other Ringu movies. Not that the movie ever becomes truly scary but it has a nice eerie atmosphere that Japanese horror movies are so well known and liked for. <br /><br />So all in all, as a part of the Ringu series this movie perhaps isn\\'t that great but as a stand alone movie it simply is a very good one. <br /><br />8/10',\n",
       " 'I liked Ringu 0 better than Rasen, it explained more about Sadako\\'s history. Which you don\\'t see too much of in any other \"Ring\" movies. It helped you build a person to person relationship with the character, rather then seeing her as a \\'mean\\' abused child it portrays her as just an abused child. You sort of take pity on her through this movie, rather then thinking she\\'s an evil spirit trying to raise hell. The actress who played Sadako was, what seemed to me, the only person that could play her. I felt they could\\'ve mixed in more suspense, and more thrills. That would have made for a better J-horror movie. It doesn\\'t compare to the movies brought out by Tartan Asia Exteme. Such as Tale of Two Sisters, Phone, (Memento Mori, Whispering Corridors, Wishing Stairs) a trilogy, Premonition, H, Oldboy, and many others. If you enjoyed watching Rasen, Ringu 0, Ringu, and Ringu 2, you\\'ll love the Tartan Asia Extreme movies. \\'Phone\\' was my personal favorite, look at the acting of the little girl and you will see why.',\n",
       " \"The film fleshes out the back story of the Ring trilogies' demon / troubled soul, Sadako, (played by Yukie Nakama), following her attempts to join an acting troupe and at the same time cope with her troubled psyche and the events of her mysterious past that still engulf her.<br /><br />The film itself has a fundamentally creepy atmosphere throughout but as with many prequels never really equals the original story, in this case never really delivering the same level of suspense, (although it does come close a couple of times), and failing to shock in the way the original did with Sadako being a silent Reagan, (The Exorcist), type character staring at you hatefully through a horrifically blood shot eye, peering through a nest of slimy, sinister, long black hair.<br /><br />The prequel enriches Sadako's character with a somewhat moving back-story, showing her coming of age, discovering acting, which she also finds therapeutic and finding true love in the arms of Hiroshi Tôyama, (Seiichi Tanabe). This sees a lot of the scenes shot inside a theatre, which provides a suitably eerie backdrop for Sadako's doomed quest to lead a normal life and battle the demons of her past that lurk ever closer.<br /><br />With regards to filling in the blanks left open in Ring and Ring 2, this film does very little, for we are already aware that Sadako was pushed to the bottom of the well by her step father, and only hints at the source of the true evil lurking inside her, without giving a clue of its origin or past. This could, arguably, be a good thing as it still leaves a veil of mystery over the first two films.<br /><br />The actors do a reasonably good job throughout, with a special hats off to Seiichi Tanabe who conveyed the confused yet blindly in love hero Tôyama. Nakama brought a certain level of pity to the role of Sadako, a girl seemingly running away from the evil that surrounds and trying to do the right thing.<br /><br />In conclusion Ring O does add depth to the trilogy and deepens rather then clarifies the mystery and in the same way to the recently released Starwars prequels, infuses the film's near one dimensional monster with a sense of depth, which serves to draw pity from it's audience. Over all not a bad prequel, which still leaves most of the questions unanswered, but whether you see that as a good or bad thing is up to you...\",\n",
       " \"Though a little bit confusing at times, this movie is everything I expected from a Ringu prequel. The only reason that doesn't make this one my favorite of the series is because it couldn't exist without the others. Ringu 1 and 2 are more than a prerequisite; you have to see them to plainly enjoy this one! Of course, I love Asian horror, from Audition to The Eye to Chinese Ghost Story! What I mean is: if you're not into Asian horror films don't start with Ringu 0, you might get lost and never want to experience it again. If you're a fan of the original Ringu and other Asian ghost movies, go ahead and enjoy! You'll get to know a little better who Sadako really was before she died, how the curse was born and what makes this whole story so sad and scary at the same time. I also recommend to watch it more than once because it has nothing to do with American fastfood film-making, so there might be things that are misunderstood during the first viewing. The order I suggest to follow if you haven't seen any of the Ringu films: start with Part 1, then Part 2, then Part 0. There's another movie called Rasen which I haven't seen yet, so I can't tell you about it.\",\n",

It shows you how Sadako came to be, the girl in the well, & the girl on TV.<br /><br />Sadako is a teenager {How!? When she kills as a little girl!? Doesn\\'t make sense? It will if you watch it.} & she is in an acting troupe to get away from her problems, & she witnesses love & fear.<br /><br />You get to see the REAL side of her, & see how unfair Sadako really was treated.<br /><br />Please watch this movie.

       " 'Not overwhelmingly bad yet nothing all too great about this one either.<br /><br />Long, dull, mundane prequel offering precious few scares. Looks like an average TV movie. There\\'s some atmosphere oozing from it but not that much overall, has a strong amateurish feel to it as well. A few scenes may make you jump. The rest is all cold bleak stares accompanied by a silent soundtrack. Ohhh, scary.<br /><br />To avoid, except for the snobby critics who\\'ll find any foreign film \"interesting\" or to those that \"must\" see it for bragging rights. It\\'s basically 90 mns of people starring at one another with little else going on.<br /><br />Artificially slow, dull pace doesn\\'t make a film a masterpiece by any standards, except for those with poor taste.

       " \"I haven't read other people's comments yet which will leave this opinion unbiased.<br /><br />I believe RING 0 was a phenomenal film and a brilliant prequel to the first two films RINGU and RINGU 2. I noticed a different director made it and the actress who played Sadako was not in it apparently so I thought it was a director cashing in on the popularity of the first two films. How brilliantly I was proven wrong?<br /><br />RING 0 seemed no different in terms of direction and the time period. It was as though all 3 films were made at the same time, I love it when there isn't a horridly noticeable gap between productions, which ruins the feeling you get from the original.<br /><br />At first, RING 0 seemed to throw me off and again; I was worried that it would not be the same style as the previous two movies. However, RING 0 was directed and produced in what looks to be the perfect way for a late prequel. It gave us pretty much all the info we were left wanting from the two movies.<br /><br />So apart from filling in the storyline and time gap for a prequel, how did the movie rate in terms of horror? Well horrific is one word to describe it. I'm very hard to scare but all three of the RING movies have managed to give me intense nightmares and fears of a little girl with black hair and RING 0 pretty much smashed my nerves completely with it's use of Sadako. Throughout the film they seem to make Sadako stand out in the movie like she will have in the minds of many fans and that did it for me. After the first two movies I would sometimes think I saw the shape of Sadako reflected in my TV, or in a corner. RING 0 puts those images on screen, right in front of you which shatters whatever you have left of confidence.<br /><br />I genuinely found myself cowering in a sense as to what would be around the corner, what would the character see when he/she turned around. It brings the semi-realistic fears I had from RING and RING 2 to life in this movie and just makes it worse for me. Scenes where you would just see Sadako's feet walking by the camera across the screen and a character not daring to look up.<br /><br />I should leave it there, to say the least this film was just as intense, perhaps surprisingly more so with the use of images of Sadako here and there such as the forest scene at the end of the movie which was just plain unnerving that she was there wherever you looked. Not attacking you, not dead, just standing there, idle\\x85 Spooked me out big time.\",\n",
       " \"includes SPOILERS<br /><br />Well we finally we get to learn who Sadako really is. I felt sorry for Sadako after watching this film, it was really amazing to find out what really happened to her and what led her to become what she became. This is definitely the best film in the series. <br /><br />You couldn't help but sympathize for Sadako after seeing how much hatred she had recieved for being different. Her tragic and horrible death at the theatre and her second death when her father throws her in the well made Ringu 0: Baadusei an incredible sad story. To only think that that young and beautiful girl was inside the well for 30 years and couldn't get out (almost) justifies everything she did afterwards.<br /><br />Sadako just wanted her story to be told. A must for all the Ringu fanatics.\",\n",

Great acting (the lead actress is as great as she is cute), great music, great direction.\",\n",
       " \"Considering this more of a drama than a horror movie it's quite a nice ending (or beginning) of this trilogy. At the end I actually felt for Sadako as where in part I & II I found her pretty scary. The cruelty of the people is what shocked me in this one and makes it hard to watch. The ending is pretty strong and quite surprising. See it, even if you don't like drama and prefer horror!\",\n",
       " 'It took me a long while to rent out this film due to the fact that I suspected it to be a \"in it for the money\" release. Basically, the film studios knew they had a good license here and wanted to milk it for all its worth, regardless of quality. A good example of this kind of capitalistic thinking would be the Highlander or Robocop movies. But, when after reading the credits in back of the case I realized it had been written by the same author of the first film (Ringu). This was enough justification for me to shell out my hard earned £3.75 and take a risk on it.<br /><br />I had expected (in true Ring formula) , dark claustrophobic sets, classy underplayed acting, a slow forbidding plot line, intermingled with sudden jarring frights to keep you on your toes, that eventually build up to terrifying climatic end. What I didn\\'t expect to watch was a tragic love story of the person we had all feared in the first two film encounters (sadako). Don\\'t get me wrong, this is still a creepy film and throughout there is always a sense of dread and fatality especially with the romantic plot line. While watching I had a fear that it was just going to be a Japanese \"Carrie\" clone. But although there are similarities this is still very much a unique film. As a prequel should , it answers questions and fills in gaps that lead the audience perfectly into Ringu with a greater understanding of the characters and events that are to take place (George Lucas should take notes).<br /><br />All in all a very well directed film with a talented cast and a great story.',\n",
       " \"Well well after the 2 first Ringu's that i enjoyed soooo much because of the scary screenplays, Ringu 0 brings us a very different prequel with this on, if you expect seeing as much scary scenes as in Ringu 1 and 2, then i hope you will read this first so at least you know that it won't, it is explains about all what you needed to know, with a end you already know but hehe it is a prequel so what else could it have been. Anyway the movie is different but good with a great acting of Yukie Nakama that play sakoma a perfect way, i mean the way she moves is like ring 1 and 2, gratz for that, she probably needed to train to walk like that all the time :) Only little thing that is a bit dissapointing in this movie is that we would perhaps would have loved to be in a bit more different places, most of the movie is in 1 very same place and start to look more like a theater then really a movie, it gets very good again once they get out of there, but until then the movie had some boring parts, otherwise great movie if you don't see it the same way as Ringu 1 and 2.\",\n",

The movie includes the origin of the mysterious girl that is Sadako. If you watched the previous Ring movies this is a source of all the confusion and questions that are embedded in the movies mentioned. Unlike the Ringu and Ring 2 this has a slower pace even though the movie was short it felt long because of the pacing. It was not scary as the others compare but this is a different genre you're looking at. Ring 0 is a good movie with tremendous writing prowess shown. The cast was smooth and the directing is not sub-par to the other Ring movies which are considered one of its kind in the genre.\",\n",

Wonderfully done, I think the best comment is anothers, in that this movie 'puts the prequels of star wars to color by numbers shame'. There is so much to this, it's just breathtaking. The shooting is done well, the acting is superb, and it puts Sadako in to a TOTALLY new light, and will really force you to think a bit more about Ring and it's sequels. It's difficult for me to put this in words, but trust me, this is very much a movie to see without fail. You will enjoy it greatly, though I promise you, you will be VERY depressed by it.

Great sound edit as well except for a couple of the over the top screams in the forest. Solid ending and really a great way to get everyone on the same page at last about who the hell Sadako really is and how she actually died. Sweet. Really enjoyed the Dutch roll camera tilt during the conversation between Sadako and her \"dad\". And who can forget the excellent reveal of the two dead ladies and their home made instant wall flowers? Sadako is an inspiration to disco floors world wide with her crazy possessed resurrected girl two-step approach.

It was great to see the plot unfold in unexpected ways, and to see these characters mess with one another, motivated only by greed, lust, and fear. Another aspect is the film\\'s sleek and cold style. From the wardrobes to the apartments these characters occupy, the film is pretty stylin\\'. And the acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne is excellent as the amoral Crowe, Frank Langella is elegantly nasty as Grimes, and Michael Beach has a deceptively quiet role as one of Fishburne\\'s \"co-workers\".

Ellen Barkin plays the devious (bad) company recruiter who signs on ex agent Laurence Fishbourne whose 140 IQ proves no match for her physical talents. By bribing the compromised judge (David Ogden Stiers) they will rescue their client Walter Curl (Spalding Grey) from a lawsuit that claims that his company dumped cancer causing pollutants. Though the judge is a gambling philanderer, he's in nobody's pocket, and thus, after taking the bribe, votes his conscience on the case in question, and then opts out after sending his girlfriend (Gia Carides) to the Bahamas with the money. Meanwhile Barkin maneuvers Fishbourne through sex into killing company head Frank Langella, showing that IQ comes in a distant second to sex appeal. Nobody (except maybe Carides and Stiers, and to a certain extent Fishbourne) is going to win much sympathy from the audience, but the story stays on task all the way through, and the observations it casts on corportate behavior are not so far out.\",\n",

The story line and plot twists are very Thomas, but the characters seemed a little one-dimensional. He is great at building characters in his novels, but there just isn't enough time to do that in a movie. I needed to see vulnerability in each character, when all that was given was cold calculation (which even the hardest CIA agent is NOT).<br /><br />The sex scenes seemed forced, and I bet that they weren't in the original script. Thomas doesn't need to use sex to relate characters to each other, but it's a quick 'gimmie' for the film.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to any Ross Thomas fan, especially given that it was probably the last thing he wrote before he died.

       " '\"Tomorrow is Forever\" is a typical example of the type of films that came out of the Hollywood of the 40s. This seems to have been brought to the screen as a vehicle for Claudette Colbert, one of the most admired actresses of that era. Under the direction of Irving Pichel, we get a wonderful account of a woman whose husband is killed during the last days of WWI. The music score by Max Steiner enhances the film, although it feels obtrusive, at times.<br /><br />Claudette Colbert was a prolific star of all the melodramas that were tailor made for her to shine. Her Elizabeth Hamilton in this film is a typical role she, and other actresses, played during that era. \"Tomorrow is Forever\" is interesting because of Orson Welles\\' appearance as the supposedly dead husband that returns under a different disguise.<br /><br />Today\\'s audiences don\\'t have patience to deal with what for the movie going public in the early days were able to allow in the reality department. Some negative comments to this forum express that viewpoint, but in spite of them, films like this will always be immensely rewarding for those fans that feel comfortable with the plots created for this type of movies.<br /><br />Claudette Colbert makes a wonderful Elizabeth. Orson Welles was the real surprise in the dramatic role that Ms. Colbert championed for him, at a time of his life that he wasn\\'t recognized for his genius. George Brent, a reliable actor, is seen as one of the decent men he played in films. Lucile Watson, as Aunt Jessie, is an asset. The young Richard Long plays Drew, the eldest son that has no clue who his father really is, but grows up believing the kind Lawrence is his dad.

       " 'Since the first time I saw this wonderful film on late-night TV, maybe 30 years ago, it has been my sentimental favorite. Every time I\\'ve seen it since, once a year on average, it\\'s made me weep; not many films ever have this effect on me, even once. I simply don\\'t understand why it isn\\'t better known, not to mention better regarded. The touching story, fine direction, good score and superb acting add up to a great experience. For me, the performances by Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles are their most effective; hers ranks with her work in \"Three Came Home\" and \"Since You Went Away,\" while his is even finer than in \"The Stranger.\" Anyone who loves a good old-fashioned love story, sob story, multi-generational saga of the type Hollywood used to make so well should give this one a try.',\n",
       " 'I am stunned to see the vast majority of commentators describe this great film as \"typical,\" \"sentimental,\" and \"melodramatic.\" That is to completely overlook the various philosophical and psychological aspects of the movie. Isolationism. Pacifism. Opposition to global hegemony and tyranny. All of these are at the essence of the dialog and the story. The need for humans to deny the temptation to live in the past and to embrace the future is the core of the movie - in addition to its TITLE. Reason must overcome emotionalism.<br /><br />That is made especially apparent in the scene where Kessler (Orson Welles) implicitly compares Mrs. Hamilton (Claudette Colbert) to his young charge, Margaret (Natalie Wood). While Mrs. Hamilton lost her husband on another continent, the Nazis murdered Margaret\\'s parents right before her eyes. She is terrified by a \"popper\" because it causes her to \"relive\" the sound of bullets, the smell of gunpowder and the sight of blood - her parents\\' blood. Kessler gently coaxes Margaret into pulling the string on a second \"popper\" to prove that she doesn\\'t need to be a victim of her fears. She can learn that it is not dangerous, but a mere \"toy.\" She can overcome.<br /><br />The climactic scene between Kessler and Mrs. Hamilton is equally fabulous. The tension steadily mounts as Mrs. Hamilton presses Kessler to admit that he is her husband. Until his direct denial, the dialog is so sublime that it makes sense whether delivered by the woman\\'s lost husband or by \"Mr. Kessler.\" But it is not sentimental. To the contrary, Kessler\\'s powerful philosophical arguments and psychological insights compel Mrs. Hamilton to reassess her life and come to the realization that it has been, is, and promises to be good. To throw that away for a memory would be sheer sentimental folly. \"Embrace the good life you have\" is the very clear message.<br /><br />This movie has layers upon layers. It contains paradoxes and ironies that are profound enough for real reflection. The characters provide profound contrasts in philosophy and psychology. The device of having a husband apparently die (but in actuality refuse to return home because of his \"broken\" condition) provides ample opportunity for sentimentality. But that device is merely the springboard for a much richer exploration of the meaning of life and our place in the world. To fail to recognize this is to minimize this fabulous film and miss its point.<br /><br />Generally the acting is superb, however, in particular this is possibly Orson Welles\\' finest performance. There are no obvious double-takes or overly-long stares that are dead give-aways in most films that deal with a character with a hidden identity. This is a fabulously subtle performance. Welles\\' makeup is a little obvious and theatrical, but is not a distraction.<br /><br />In an incredible - and incredibly overlooked - performance, Natalie Wood convincingly portrays a young Austrian girl who speaks German as her native tongue, has lost both parents to Nazi violence and is suddenly thrust into a strange new country. Her performance is one of the best juvenile performances in all American cinema. <br /><br />The Max Steiner score is also very good, although I wish it had been a little more sub rosa. Just turning down the volume of the score to make it a little more subtle would have improved the film a little. However, it beautifully captures the mood of each scene.',\n",
       " 'Rather unsung, but worthwhile, this tear-jerking wartime drama will entrance some viewers while unintentionally amusing others. Colbert plays a young newlywed whose husband (Welles) goes off to fight in WWI. He is severely injured, refuses to come home to her (or even give his name to authorities) and is presumed dead. Pregnant and alone, she relies on her employer (Brent) and his aunt (Watson) and before long agrees to wed Brent, who is very much in love with her. Flash-forward twenty years and Colbert and Brent have two sons, the first one actually Welles\\', though this is kept secret. Welles, crippled, aged, bearded, wearing thick glasses and sporting an even thicker accent comes to town to work for Brent, never dreaming that his former wife is now Brent\\'s spouse. Just as Colbert has finally found a degree of happiness and has nearly forgotten Welles, whom she loved deeply, WWII threatens to break out and her eldest son (Long) is eager to go and fight! The film details the questions, mysteries and miseries of Welles and Colbert as they encounter each other again after two decades. Unabashedly sentimental and heart-tugging, it is likely to please fans of tear-jerkers while causing the eyes of pragmatists to roll feverishly. Colbert is lovely and exceedingly good in her role. It\\'s always distracting, in hindsight, to view Colbert\\'s films and observe the way she refuses to allow herself to be shot from her right side, but she\\'s not as bad about that here as in some other films. Welles is mercilessly hammy and is buried under some truly horrendous age makeup. He goes way overboard in virtually every area, yet somehow it works to the film\\'s benefit! Brent, already one of the most wooden of actors, is made even more so by the presence of Welles, but it\\'s a nice contrast. Long has a particularly good early role (even if he hadn\\'t quite grown into his nose at this point!) He is given a strong, sizable role for an actor his age. The always-reliable and entertaining Watson gives solid support. One of the greatest things about the film, however, is the utterly adorable and memorably adept presence of Wood as Welles\\' adopted daughter. Impossibly articulate, inhumanly precious and achingly touching in her role as a war orphan, she is a thorough delight. It was her first major role and she handles it with surprising poise and assurance. Her older sister instructed her on how to cry during the film, suggesting that she recall a ghastly accident she had witnessed involving her dog being hit by a car. It\\'s very poignant to see her dainty little fingers helping Welles unbutton his vest, knowing that her life would later end so tragically. Working alongside Welles no doubt helped prep her for her famed role opposite Edmund Gwenn in \"Miracle of 34th Street\" one year later.',\n",
       " 'What a powerful story! So powerful to me, at least, that I have only watched it one other time and have little desire to see it again.....even though it\\'s a fine movie. It\\'s too frustrating a story for me, frankly. I could NOT have done what Orson Welles\\' character did in this film. Welles, by the way, is outstanding in here. He, Claudette Colbert, George Brent and Richard Long provide some wonderful acting.<br /><br />Long, playing the elder son, presents a tremendous contrast of how a young man acted back in the 1940s compared to nowadays in terms of of respect and manners. The little girl in here is played by Natalie Wood. I wouldn\\'t have known it was her had she not been mentioned on the back of the video box. She has blonde hair and is about five or six years old, and does an impressive job speaking German.<br /><br />This is a real heart-rendering story. The only drawback is the credibility of Colbert\\'s character, \"Elizabeth Hamilton,\" the wife of Welles. A supposed war victim and gone for years after his marriage to her, Wells - despite now having a beard and aging a bit - would still be recognizable (at the least, audibly) to his former wife. It was asking a bit much to believe she wouldn\\'t realize it was him, but it\\'s still good storytelling and a film that hits you deeply. Speaking about the last point, if you liked 1942\\'s \"Random Harvest,\" you probably would like this, too.',\n",

Brent brings over to work in his firm a Viennese chemist who turns out to be -- Orson Welles, bringing in tow a blonde, very young (her debut, in fact) Natalie Wood, speaking German.<br /><br />Ever the gemutlich gentleman, Welles keeps his cards close to his vest, even when talking about the \"situation overseas\" with the strapping lad he now realizes is his son, who wants to enlist in the Canadian Air Force. Colbert, however, is deeply conflicted. She comes to resent Welles\\' presence while nonetheless suspecting that he may in fact be....<br /><br />Tomorrow Is Forever addresses the dislocations and disruptions of wartime in a manner unusual for American movies of this era. Somewhat far-fetched and sentimental, it\\'s a well cast topical weeper that manages, paradoxically, to maintain a tone of high seriousness while nevertheless skirting most of the issues it raises. Long on emotion, it falls short of real insight.',\n",
       " \"It's interesting to compare the hero's sacrifice in Tomorrow is Forever with the hero's in Casablanca. Rick (Bogart) leaves Ilsa in Casablanca to her husband for the good of the world, and for a cause he believes in (fighting the Nazis) -- a cause he will participate in. But John/Erik (Welles), while he leaves Elizabeth for the good of the same cause he fervently believes in, can not participate. He is crippled and sickly from the First World War (he is probably emasculated, as well). Unlike Rick, he can neither reveal his identity or his love for the woman he left behind -- even though she may know it. He only says openly that the cause is all. But, unlike Rick, he is lying within himself. Elizabeth is the abiding passion in his life, his only possibility of emotional fulfillment. Yet, even so, the world comes first. And he sacrifices for this cause to the point of his own non-existence. It is truly the greater sacrifice. It is a wonderfully acted film, which makes the lost love of John and Elizabeth the most poignant I have ever shared as a movie viewer.\",\n",
       " '\"Tomorrow Is Forever\" is a great movie. I think Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles are great together. And even though Orson Welles rarely played the romantic lead, he\\'s wonderful.

       " \"Director Irving Pichel got so much out of Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert in this movie. Colbert's character is not only believable but strong yet vulnerable, too. I never figured Orson Welles would do well in a part like this, but he exceeded very convincingly by pulling off one of his better roles. This movie was the debut for Richard Long(19), and he was the right person for the role as Claudette Colbert's son. Natalie Wood (8) plays a fine adopted daughter from Europe with an Austrian accent that is quite believable. Two things which really hold this movie together are Irving Pichel's excellent tight directing and Max Steiner's musical score. Pichel is an expert at timing, drama, and suspense. During the final scene, there is no possible way you will leave the screen. Max Steiner always comes up with the right style for his movies, and this movie is definitely a showcase for his sensitive score. His use of strings and wind instruments are so well-placed at the right time, and his music provides a thread which enhances the drama and keeps us on track.\",\n",
       " 'This is a deeply moving story with superb acting although I didn\\'t reach for the Kleenex. I would call it a very difficult lesson in life to be learned, about letting go of the past and thinking of present values and the future instead - reaching forward to the positive in life and releasing the past - something not everyone is prepared to do.<br /><br />It is of a young couple, Elizabeth and John (Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles), who are abruptly parted by the duty of John\\'s service in the First War. He is injured badly, and while wrapped in facial bandages in hospital he makes the decision not to notify next of kin and drop out of his young wife\\'s life because he feels he could never be the same man again, at least to her. So he is presumed dead. Meanwhile back home she has been notified of this tragic news and manages to deal with it bravely even though she is going to have his child. Lawrence (George Brent) steps into her life to assist then eventually they marry and create a reasonably happy life together.<br /><br />A weakness in the film that challenges us is that John\\'s features were not altered so very much in the movie after his war injuries and the required facial surgery. I think more could have been done on this point to give the film greater credibility. Basically a beard was added and graying hair to camouflage his appearance but ... I mean, if you\\'ve known someone so well, it\\'s well-nigh impossible to mistake their tone of voice or expression of the eyes ... so I had trouble getting over this shortcoming.<br /><br />Twenty years later in the unfolding story it becomes indeed a razor\\'s edge on which to tread when former wife Elizabeth again encounters John, who is now known as Erik Kessler, middle aged, graying, and has difficulty getting around. He has re-entered her life as an Austrian chemist brought to America to advise the firm which her husband operates! Small world at times, no? However, that\\'s the story.<br /><br />There is a great deal of reminiscing done by Elizabeth as she recalls touching moments from her time with John, and shows us how easy it is to look back longingly at memories of the past. But now, after nineteen years of their estrangement, reality has set in for both: Elizabeth has a family to care for, a present obligation which takes precedence, and John too has the responsibility of a young adopted daughter, Margaret (Natalie Wood).<br /><br />So while every ensuing meeting brings them closer to the truth of their former relationship, it is a very thin line indeed that separates them from the possibility of true recognition of each other and the memories of bygone days. Each encounter seems to bring more remembrance that neither of them can fully accept but for different reasons.<br /><br />I found the dialog most intriguing on several levels. It reminded me of the scales of Justice which are finely weighed for both sides yet never truly balanced. John, now known as the elderly Erik Kessler, talked of the future\\'s promise that lay ahead for Elizabeth, of how she had a good life in the present and was needed by others. Here again he nobly steps aside so that she will have a more fulfilling life although he won\\'t be part of it as he has so little to offer, or so he reasons. He points out to her that the memories of the past she holds are really of the good times and can never be recreated in the present for life has changed them both. Interestingly, it really does show us that living in the past is somehow a negative phase which never can be changed, and that we must take hold of Life in the present and look to the future where there is promise - for tomorrow is \"forever\", the past is \"never\".<br /><br />This film expresses some very fine sentiments. Have ordered the book and hope to gain more by giving it a serious reading as well.',\n",
       " 'On the brink of World War II, a man believed killed in World War I returns in \"Tomorrow is Forever,\" directed by Irving Pichel and starring Claudette Colbert, Orson Welles, George Brent, Richard Long, and Natalie Wood. After her husband John\\'s death in the first world war, Elizabeth (Colbert) finds out she\\'s pregnant. She ultimately makes a new life for herself with Lawrence (Brent), and together they have a daughter. Lawrence raises the son (Long) as his own. When \"Dr. Kessler\" (Welles), a scientist working with her husband, first appears at their home, Elizabeth doesn\\'t realize it\\'s John, who never returned to the U.S. because of his crippling, debilitating war wounds. He has a young child with him, Margaret (Wood), who it turns out is the child of his late doctor and his wife.<br /><br />This is a beautifully done movie in every respect, including Max Steiner\\'s music (though a little strong at times), and holds the viewer\\'s interest throughout. Colbert is lovely as a tormented woman who has to deal with the prospect of her son going off to war as his father did - and perhaps never returning. Her scene as she comes downstairs and sees Dr. Kessler for the first time is wonderful. Something about him startles and unnerves her immediately, and it\\'s apparent on her face. Two young actors who died too young - Richard Long and Natalie Wood - also appear in the \"Tomorrow is Forever.\" Handsome Long, who would find success in television, makes a good impression in his first film. Wood, a blond here, is absolutely adorable and very accomplished, speaking German and then English with a German accent.<br /><br />Orson Welles is an actor whose magnificent presence, acting technique, and voice allowed him to basically phone in most roles - his whole purpose in movie acting was to make money for his film projects - but obviously Irving Pinchot didn\\'t accept a phone-in from him. Welles gives a very touching and believable performance as both young John and the older, ill Dr. Kessler. \"Living in the past will not bring back what you had,\" he tells Elizabeth, \"only destroy what you have.\" A wonderful, wonderful movie.

She imprints life and humanity onto the movie screen in a timeless performance.<br /><br />Orson Welles is somehow able to tone down his larger-than-life persona and give a good performance, although the makeup job he wears is not very good. George Brent proves that there is a place for his much-maligned type of acting which is fine for this type of role. Natalie Wood delivers a great child-actor performance. The orchestrated musical score is lush, dignified, old-fashioned, and appropriate.<br /><br />Forget any reservations you may have about black-and-white, age of the film, or any other concerns.

       " \"Tomorrow Is Forever finds Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert as a pair of young marrieds during World War I when Orson announces he's enlisted in the American Expeditionary Force. The young wife sees her gallant young husband off to war, not knowing that she's pregnant. When he's reported missing in action, Claudette's all at sea. Fortunately she's got a most sympathetic boss who has an eye for her in any event. Claudette marries George Brent and they raise the son she has by Welles and they also have a son of their own.<br /><br />Although as the romantic young husband John MacDonald, Welles doesn't quite cut it, as Erik Kessler, the German refugee who in reality is John MacDonald, Welles just shines. With a heavy beard, makeup, a German accent and a shambling gait courtesy of the last war, Welles totally succeeds in recreating himself on the screen. He's so totally different you can't blame Claudette for not recognizing him, I could barely. <br /><br />On the eve of World War II, Brent who is now a big time industrialist meets Welles who is now in his Kessler persona. He brings him home and while there's something eerily familiar to Claudette he becomes an adjunct family member.<br /><br />Watching Tomorrow Is Forever I have no doubt that director Irving Pichel gave Welles total command of his character. Most likely Welles even directed some of the scenes he was involved with.<br /><br />Orson Welles throughout his life appeared in a lot of garbage using his actor's salary to continue financing his own projects. Though he's a bit weak as the young husband, as the old refugee chemist it's a brilliant characterization.

       " \"Despite a seemingly extreme requirement for suspension of disbelief at times, this film should rank much higher within its category. The story is sound and intricate, and certainly tight enough for the day. Where it is over-told, it only reflects convention. No one should miss Welles' performance, or Natalie Wood's first turn on screen. She is already mesmerizing, and her ability with languages amazing. I saw her name in the credits, but without calculating age, expected a teenager. But the second time she appeared, and smiled, I recognized her immediately and was stunned with her performance (compare most modern child performances on diction, delivery and command of emotion). <br /><br />Colbert seems able to anchor any movie. She isn't a character actress and lacks the range of a Bette Davis, certainly, but her effortless portrayal of her own humanity always grounds the story, and she seems to catalyze and enhance the other performances (a rare and subtle talent).<br /><br />Rather than retell the story or cover similar ground, I will comment on a couple of points.<br /><br />I did feel that Colbert was convinced at the end by Welles that he was not her husband John, my only doubt being the denouement when her possession of his daughter, Natalie Wood, and her exit, is so perfunctory. But even then, she shows no curiosity whatsoever about the apartment, where we know the proof exists. And this is a relatively rare example of a multiply-ending film in the 40's (could have logically ended 3 or 4 times). Each of the final scenes would necessarily be succinct--BUT would deliver any important information. And her knowing at the end would turn this drama into a melodrama, because it would have shoved her back into her grief through the end, which is I believe not the intention. <br /><br />But most significantly, if the writer or director intended that she knew, it would have been telegraphed in those days. In fact, there was nothing at all in Colbert's performance to indicate she was maintaining secret knowledge after their conversation. <br /><br />Colbert not recognizing Welles is answered by the technical conventions of the day. The complaints here really are saying that WE cannot see a drastic difference in appearance, which we could expect now. Without extreme makeup or even digital effects (a la Forrest Gump), audiences of that day would have simply accepted having been told he was horribly disfigured (theater convention). They would thereafter assume it as fact and imagine it. In the hospital in Austria, the dialog between the doctor and Welles solidly informs us that he is injured beyond recognition. The doctor even mentions plastic surgery, almost science fiction for that time.<br /><br />Overall, though the plot and theme may seem hackneyed today--and if remade would certainly leave more on the editing floor--the story is skillfully structured, acted and directed and for sure worth a watch by anyone interested in classic movies.\",\n",

At present Black and white films are not much wanted, particularly by new generations, but the present can be well accepted by them. It goes step by step with an acting of Welles simply extraordinary, the way he moves the way he talks and argues in the film is nearly normal. The end was logic and obviously tragic. We would need more materials like these, i.e. with less violence and good humanistic messages.',\n",

       " \"Despite the movie's Harlequin-level romance novel title, the unlikely pairing of classic Hollywood leading lady Claudette Colbert and resident bad-boy Orson Welles actually works in this intriguing albeit far-fetched 1946 melodrama directed by the relatively undistinguished Irving Pichel. Written by Lenore J. Coffee, the plot concentrates initially on newly married John and Elizabeth McDonald, who are suddenly separated when he enlists for combat duty during WWI. Just as she discovers she is pregnant, Elizabeth receives word that John is dead, but the truth is that he is so badly injured that he doesn't want to return to her as a cripple. Once recovered, he takes on the guise of an Austrian scientist named Erik Kessler. Twenty years elapse, and Elizabeth has remarried to businessman Larry Hamilton, who has coincidentally recruited Kessler to test the company's new product formula. Elizabeth meets Kessler but does not recognize him to be her long lost John due to plastic surgery. However, John knows her, and they become intertwined again when their son Drew decides to enlist in the RAF years before the U.S. enters WWII.<br /><br />The story sounds preposterous on paper, but it is quite compelling to see the movie evolve toward its inevitable resolution. Colbert is her naturally effervescent self, though she is well into her forties here and a mite too mature for the early scenes when she is playing a blushing newlywed to the twelve-years younger Welles. Nonetheless, she provides surprising bite to the scenes where Elizabeth confronts her own prejudices about war. In the juiciest role, Welles has a field day as the crippled, defeated Kessler as he keeps his naturally grandiose manner in check. Perennial also-ran George Brent is wooden as expected as Hamilton, but a couple of familiar faces shine as the children - Richard Long as the grown Drew and an eight-year old Natalie Wood, blonde and sporting a convincing Austrian accent, as Kessler's adopted daughter Margaret. There are some lapses in credibility beginning with Elizabeth's inability to recognize John and ending with her rather sudden resignation that John is right in his perspective on the past. Regardless, it's a surprisingly involving movie with a mature perspective on love and war, a curio sadly forgotten today and well worth a look now.\",\n",

It is hard to find anything to criticize...the acting all around is superb, the casting was perfect, and the direction was impeccable. Natalie Wood's VERY early portrayal of a native-speaking Austrian girl is rather remarkable for her age, too.<br /><br />The very unusual plot lines are woven together quite well, and right up to the end you cannot be sure just what is going to happen to resolve -- maybe -- everything.

       " \"This movie is sad beyond words, beyond tears. Of course,the unstated truth is that Elizabeth is right, by joining the RAF, Drew is probably sealing his fate. A different but equally sad truth is stated when Elizabeth accuses Erik of being, perhaps, the one who killed John and he concurs because he did kill John rather than returning a lesser, perhaps unmanned, husband. The horror of war and the fact that it is sometimes necessary for us to go on. Sad beyond words, beyond tears and beyond bearing. Some historians believe that war is man's natural state of being and that would give this old movie currency beyond the coincidence of whether a big war is happening when the movie is viewed. It is always true and always sad, sad beyond words.\",\n",
       " 'Orson Welles falls in to a kind of archaic theatrical acting style in this wonderful, tear-jerker of a film. As \"Erik Kessler,\" a man who returns under an assumed identity to the wife who has remarried because she though he was dead, he\\'s heavily made-up and talks with a corny and contrived sounding German accent. Of course, that\\'s the point, he doesn\\'t want his wife to recognize him, but one can\\'t help thinking that his wife Elizabeth (Claudette Colbert) is better off with the smooth and sophisticated Lawrence Hamilton (George Brent). What if they switched roles? What if Brent played Kessler and Welles played Hamilton? Now that would put Elizabeth in a really tough position. As it is, Kessler\\'s so unattractive (in woman\\'s film terms) that the female audience knows there\\'s no way she\\'s going to leave Hamilton. As it is, Elizabeth gets the best of all possible worlds. Her first (problematic) husband disappears during the war; she gets a rich and handsome second husband who\\'s only shortcoming seems to be that he\\'s not truly attentive to her sons from her first marriage. Fortunately for her, husband number one comes back just in the nick of time to save their son from a foolish decision. And then he just as conveniently dies, an unopened letter beside him that Elizabeth and Lawrence somehow fail to see. And they get an adorable new little adopted daughter in the process. This little girl will take away the pain that we\\'ve learned Elizabeth is going to feel as her boys go off into the world. So it\\'s a perfect ending for Elizabeth--her unattractive, preachy first husband is now permanently out of the way and she can look forward to a more satisfying marriage with the handsome and agreeable Lawrence.',\n",

The storyline was somewhat inventive, and would have worked much better with a more talented duo. The sole reason to watch this film would be to see Thelma Todd, and Dorothy Lee.

       " 'It was made to a formula and revolves around most of the cliches in the Western handbook but it was hard not to enjoy this film.<br /><br />It is based on the life of the famous Texan John Wesley Hardin. His youth was shaped by the Civil War and by his preacher father. When his father forbids him to practise shooting young Wes reckons its about time to leave home and seek his fortune. Almost immediately he kills a local gunslinger and plunges into the life of a rootin tootin cowboy, gambler and outlaw.<br /><br />It has a classic opening a dignified man walking out of the prison gates, shaking hands with the warden and sniffing the air of freedom. It has an equally recognisable ending, back at the ranch to see how his wife and family have managed during the long years of incarceration.<br /><br />The final scenes of the film are lovely, it won\\'t spoil the film to say he learned from his experiences and lived a long and happy life.<br /><br />There is nothing new in this film. Although it claims to be an autobiography, it is one of countless 1950\\'s Westerns with a theme of a young man seeking adventure and finding redemption. The real strength of the movie is its star Rock Hudson, barrel chested and manly, who shoots, rides, kisses, gambles and drinks as well as any of his contemporaries. One of the baddies is a young Lee Van Cleef who easily steals scenes from his fellow wrong-doers.<br /><br />It won\\'t change your life, the way \"Shane\" might have done but it won\\'t hurt you to watch it, and to remember Rock Hudson in the way he should be remembered.',\n",
       " \"The Lawless Breed, a western very loosely based on the life of John Wesley Hardin, was a milestone film for young Rock Hudson. Rock was 28 when he made this film for Universal and for the first time he was given first billing in a film. Universal also gave him veteran action director Raoul Walsh and a supporting cast that knew its way around the set of a western.<br /><br />John Wesley Hardin(1853-1895), one of the most notorious of bad men in the old west was also one of the few who actually got to put his story down for posterity. The film that you see is based somewhat on some of the incidents in Hardin's life. He was not as noble a character as The Lawless Breed would have you believe, but a whole lot of things attributed to him were probably pure hokum. The dime novels of the day worked their way into the popular culture for just about every character of the old west, good and bad. <br /><br />As shown here, the real John Wesley Hardin was shot in the back in a saloon after his release from prison. But the story goes that during a preview of the film, the audience reaction was so negative to seeing Rock Hudson shot down like a dirty dog that Universal felt compelled to tack on a happy ending. The film was really supposed to end with him dying on the floor of the saloon telling his son played by Race Gentry not to follow in his footsteps. What was added on was a scene with wife Julie Adams and Gentry loading the wounded Rock on the back of a buckboard and after a bit of dialog they ride off in the sunset.<br /><br />So one western legend got scrapped to start the career of a movie legend. Only in Hollywood.<br /><br />John McIntire has a nice dual performance as Hudson's circuit riding preacher father and as his uncle, a cattle rancher. And there was a gang of brothers that Hudson kept tangling with the entire film, the Hanleys played by such western familiars as Lee Van Cleef, Michael Ansara, Hugh O'Brian, and Glenn Strange. <br /><br />It's not a bad film despite the obviously tacked on happy ending for Rock's fans. John Wesley Hardin probably would have liked how it came out.\",\n",

Like shooting a man for snoring. I am honored that the Hollywood \"factor\" would cast Rock Hudson as John Wesley, as John W was a very handsome man according to the tintographs I have of him from my g-grandmother. This is an under-rated movie worth watching and the female lead is indeed an actress under-rated - she is lovely and supportive. A grand western! AMB',\n",
       " '\"The Lawless Breed\" attempts to tell the life story of John Wesley Hardin, the misunderstood gunfighter, from his point of view.<br /><br />The story begins with Hardin (Rock Hudson) being released from prison after serving 16 of 25 years for murder. He goes to the local newspaper and presents the editor with a hand written story of his life. The film then flashes back to his youth where young \"Wes\" is practicing his fast draw. His father, Preacher J.G. Hardin (John McIntyre) takes a whip to him, condemning his life style. Wes decides to leave home and pursue his dream of earning enough money to buy a small horse ranch for himself and his sweetheart Jane Brown (Mary Castle).<br /><br />The rest of the film can be summed up with the phrase, \"I never killed anyone who didn\\'t try to kill me first\". He is forced to gun down gambler Gus Handley (Michael Ansara) which brings upon him the wrath of his three brothers, Ike (Hugh O\\'Brian), Dirk (Lee Van Cleef) and Ben (Glenn Strange).<br /><br />While trying to escape a posse, Hardin hides out with his uncle John Clements (McIntyre again) and his sons Jim (Dennis Weaver) and Joe (Richard Garland). When he returns home to fetch Jane, she is killed during his escape from the farm. Hardin takes solace in the arms of \"saloon girl\" Rosie (Julia Adams) whom he later marries.<br /><br />Ready to surrender to the law after his planned marriage, Hardin is double-crossed and...........................................<br /><br />Rock Hudson, on the verge of becoming a super star, turns in an excellent performance as the troubled Hardin. He plays the character over a 20 year period. This was one of his first starring roles. He benefited greatly from the direction of the veteran director Raoul Walsh who managed to expose his real talent for the first time.<br /><br />As in most of Universal\\'s fast paced little eighty minute color westerns, there is plenty of action and beautiful Technicolor photography. It also had the benefit of a cast of recognizable supporting players, most of whom had appeared in countless \"B\" westerns. In addition to those already mentioned above, Steve Darrell appears as Sheriff Jenkins, Robert Anderson as Wild Bill Hickcock, Dick Wessel, Emory Parnell and I.

Remember Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita.<br /><br />This has got to be one of the most stylish, moody and gripping films in existence. Luc Besson's direction is refreshing whilst the cinematography is simply stunning, particuarly the scene in the hotel where Nikita gets her first assignment. The soundtrack by Eric Serra is simply genius and actually adds something to the film...soundtracks usually seem to be an afterthought but refreshingly; not in this case.<br /><br />The beautiful Anne Parillaud is perfect in the lead role (unlike Bridget Fonda) and the subtle romance between her and Tcheky Karyo is pure eloquence. The hugely talented Jean-Hughes Anglade (of Betty Blue fame) shines in this film but of all the male roles, Jean Reno (also fabulous in Luc Besson's Leon)is outstanding as the completely unbalanced Victor The Cleaner. Jeanne Moreau as Amande makes a notable appearence following years of contributions in countless films.<br /><br />Luc Besson established himself as one of the leading innovative directors with this film and you can easily see why. This movie certainly rates among the top 10 films of all time.<br /><br />I could pontificate about this film all day and all night but the best thing is for you to watch it yourself as a matter of priority...it is a 'must see'.<br /><br />I'm off now to pursue a career in international assassinations.\",\n",
       " 'Anne Parillaud is phenomenal as a terrifyingly vulnerable, beautiful and human young anti-hero with an incredible talent for violence. A drug-addict murderous teen is given a second chance by a government agency looking to exploit her penchant for conscience-less killing. Mentored by a man whose compassion for her is only matched by his ambition and Machiavellian sadism, Nikita ventures on a roller-coaster ride leading a double-life as assassin and clean-living young woman in love. Her passionate affair with Marco and the clarity of her un-drugged consciousness, combine to promote the development of a conscience - a dangerous thing in her line of work. Nikita is, nevertheless, a victim of her circumstances, and like the rest of the characters on both sides, seems stuck in a very bad situation. In addition to the artistry with which this story is told, this film has a very nihilistic sense of justice and not-so-subtly points out the fact that state authorized murder is still murder. <br /><br />Jean Reno fans will enjoy his brief typecast cameo as \"the cleaner\".<br /><br />This is one of the best, if not the best, of Besson\\'s films. It is extremely well paced, starkly and beautifully shot, and features some of the best acting and writing of the entire action genre. The script is just a little better in French than English. Nikita does not have the feel of an action film, but rather, feels like a fatalistic drama riddled with almost continuous tragedy and heartbreak, and spiced with just a tad of hope. Parillaud\\'s multi-layered and complex construction of her character is so mesmerizing that it is frankly difficult to think of anything else while attempting to reflect on this film.',\n",
       " 'This 1989 French film was justifiably so popular that an American re-make followed later and then a cable television series followed after that. <br /><br />In this - the original - you see \"Nikita\" at its beginning and, most people agree, at her best. Anne Parillaud, an actress I\\'ve always found fascinating, is riveting as the lead character. Jean-Huges Anglade, Tcheky Karyo and Jean Reno provide a very strong supporting cast.<br /><br />The characters were believable and it was refreshing to see a no-nonsense approach to a murder story, meaning if someone had to be killed, they were shot quickly with no questions asked. Some of the action scenes are brutal.<br /><br />Parillaud\\'s character is memorable. She can change appearances, from a hard- nosed hysterical animal to a real lady. It\\'s also interesting to see Reno in a familiar role as a \"cleaner,\" a role he made famous four years later in \"Leon: The Professional.\" <br /><br />The DVD provides either easy-to-read subtitles or a well-done dubbed version. If sound is important to you, you\\'ll hear better stereo with the subtitled version.',\n",
       " 'I fell in love with this film from the moment I first saw a brief clip of it on an entertainment program. At first I was drawn to the action elements (being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes), but I was blown away by the romance and character interplay. I loved the composition of the scenes, the noirish lighting, and the quirky humor. This movie, along with Pedro Almodovar\\'s films, really opened my eyes to European films, particularly those with a signature style.<br /><br />The performances are great across the board. Anne Parillaud plays all facets of Nikita well, from her rebellious, drug-hazed beginning, to her growing confidence, and her near breakdown as her mission falls apart. Tcheky Karyo made a huge impression, mostly through his body language and his eyes. He says more with an expression than most actors do with dialogue. Jeanne Moraeu is a treasure, a truly beautiful woman in appearance and spirit. Jean-Hughues Anglade has the harder part, the \"normal\" guy who Nikita falls for. He is adept at comedy, but is tender in the love scenes. He carries himself well in his face-off with Bob. Finally, the actor who really stands out in memory, Jean Reno. Reno oozes charisma and talent, even in bad films. He steals the film the moment he enters.<br /><br />Luc Besson is a tremendous stylist. His films are beautiful, even when the story is a bit obtuse. He is adept at using light to portray and enhance emotion and his compositions are stunning. His main fault is that he lets style overtake story, but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting. He is a fine writer, although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for others.<br /><br />Finally, one can\\'t discuss the films of Besson without discussing the music of Eric Serra. Serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration. His compositions convey mood and emotion, adding another layer to the story. His signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences, while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments. He demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers, to transform the music, rather than make up for lack of an orchestra (or talent). Serra\\'s soundtracks were the first that I bought for instrumental music, rather than for pop songs used in the film. <br /><br />This is a film that appeals to many audiences. There is plenty of action and intrigue for thrillseekers, unique character studies, quirky humor, and above all, romance. It has spawned many imitations (Point of No Return, Black Cat, Nikita TV series) but has never been equaled. If you are a fan of film noir, action/espionage, character drama, or romance, you should see this film; then you should own this film. You\\'ll want to watch it again and again.',\n",
       " 'The convicted cop-killer is \"kidnapped\" by a government agency to be given one new chance. Only this time she is to become a trained spy and assassin.<br /><br />Luc Besson sure know how to fill a film with passion, humanity and action. This is a truly beautiful movie. It is a rather slow movie compared to your typical Hollywood movie, but then again the story and characters are also stronger. You get hooked and the movie is finished before you know it.<br /><br />The story is strong. It\\'s cool, original and intriguing, yet it\\'s simple and not hard to keep track of. You really get caught up with it. It has elements of all genre. It\\'s got action, love and passion, drama, thriller and even some comedy in it. It\\'s kind of a dark story, yet there are lot of funny elements to light it up a bit. Not much, just as much as it needs.<br /><br />The actors are great. Anne Parillaud does a great job as Nikita. She makes a psycho-like character that you, in the beginning, don\\'t really like much, but through out the movie her real personality is revealed. At the end you won\\'t let go of her. The rest of the cast is also truly great. Jean Reno has a small, yet very nice part. I found his character really funny. The way he just barge into the story.<br /><br />Eric Serra has given the movie a nice score. It supports the story, but may seem a little late 80\\'s every now and then, but never the less it sounds good. It is passionate when needed and suspense when called for.<br /><br />You won\\'t get disappointed of cinematography. It\\'s simply beautiful. You can just sit back and enjoy the shots. Nice contrasts and nice composition and the use of wide angle lenses are really cool. The lightning is good as well. It\\'s all really enjoyable.<br /><br />This movie has something for everyone. It\\'s not a guy movie or a girl movie. It\\'s not a adult movie or a teenage movie. This is simply a movie for everyone who enjoys good movies! I can, with no doubt, give this movie my recommendations.',\n",
       " 'Luc Besson was on a hot streak in the late 80s/early 90s, and La Femme Nikita (or just Nikita for short) is almost as good as he got at putting his own distinctive stamp on a genre that many auteurs have trouble molding. The spy thriller is great for blockbuster audiences, but to make it into a strong romantic drama is always tricky, as there\\'s the chance for too much one-dimensional theatrics or more attention paid to the plot convolutions than actual human emotions. Nikita squares this problem away just with the protagonist: a young punk (Anne Parillaud, in her most recognizable, near star-making performance) who kills a cop in the midst of a shoot-out is sentenced to life, but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization, and given an ultimatum: become a spy/assassin, or die. She complies, and in a few years time turns into Josephine, who gets orders on the outside from time to time to do tasks like dress up in a maid\\'s outfit to serve potential targets, or to ready herself to kill someone long-range at a moment\\'s notice.<br /><br />Besson crafts his main story by creating a sort of love triangle between Nikita/Josephine/Marie, her boss Bob, and her conventional lover Marco, a grocery store cashier who doesn\\'t know what she really does. Besson tools with the elements for a much more conventional thriller, and from time to time it could appear like La Femme Nikita will veer into that realm and not return. But Besson is smart; he crafts the first hour like a kind of \\'Taming of the Shrew\\' saga (or \\'Taming of a Shrill Bad-ass\\'), filled with juicy, dark humor ranging from the ultra-violent (pencil in the hand anyone?) to the silly and playful (training with karate instructors). And as pure director of action sequences Besson shows himself as one of the more distinct masters; it\\'s succinctly fresh and tense while holding the ingredients for what mainstream audiences crave, chiefly in that centerpiece as she is told to kill someone on the night of a seemingly hot date with Bob. Even in the little things, like the scene where she watches the spy put together the concoction for the target in the hotel, works on the purest technical terms.<br /><br />But La Femme Nikita, for the most part, also works on emotional levels too. Besson won\\'t be above throwing in a hard-boiled killer in the midst (Jean Reno\\'s Victor, my favorite supporting character if only for a few pivotal scenes, and a precursor to Leon), but he\\'ll also subvert it just a tinge for good measure. I loved seeing when Josephine has to take out the woman in Venice, her shot in sight, and is moved to tears through the words that Marco speaks to her, truthfully, not in any terms that deem him as the boring \"safe\" character, but as her kind of salvation from a life that she\\'s been forced into as a final alternative. As happens often in Besson\\'s work, in fact, the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and, at the least, harrowing times with the one she cares for or about (i.e. Portman in Leon, Leeloo in Fifth Element, Joan of Arc, even Angela in Angel-A). It\\'s not simply a gimmick in having the character be a woman- it\\'s essential to Besson\\'s track as a filmmaker, and Praillaud is excellent for the sort of ups and downs the character goes through, sometimes in the same scene! <br /><br />This isn\\'t to say there are a few minor liabilities, if only from my perspective: the music is usually effective in that early electronic-techno beat style for a modern thriller, yet sometimes it\\'s also a cross between a soft-core porn and Weather channel muzak; the ending felt abrupt, or at least on a first viewing (albeit it\\'s hard to top the scene at the ambassador\\'s HQ); and, as a minor criticism, what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile? (Seems a little crucial as something of her personality that\\'s skipped over, when made to seem like a big stepping stone by Jeanne Moreau\\'s enigmatic character.) Otherwise, a must-see, and one of Besson\\'s best films.',\n",
       " \"Until I watched this film many years ago I'd always associated foreign language films with more talky arty films, this showed that there are top quality action films made outside Hollywood too.<br /><br />The film opens with a group of drug addicts breaking into a pharmacy to steal drugs, things go wrong and most of them are shot and killed by the police. Nikita however survives but she is captured and jailed for the murder of a police officer. She doesn't end up in jail though she is taken in by a government agency and given the choice of working for them or being killed. She chooses to work for them and spends three years being trained in a variety of skills that will enable her to work as an assassin. On her twenty third birthday Bob, her handler, takes her out of the training facility for the first time. She thinks it is just for a meal but ends up having to kill somebody and then fight her way out of the restaurant. This is her final test before being allowed to leave the facility and make a life for herself. She isn't totally free though, whenever the agency calls she must drop whatever she is doing and perform a mission. This is complicated by the fact that she now has a fiancé who does not know what she does.<br /><br />The action scenes are all very stylishly executed and the acting seemed good, although not speaking French I had to rely on the subtitles to understand what was being said. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes action films, especially to people who liked Luc Besson's later film Leon, the main character of which is based on Victor, the cleaner, in Nikita.\",\n",
       " \"Nikita lived in my mind as an action movie with lots of blood, aggression, fear, all kinds of things I'm not very fond of to watch in a cinema. But I have seen this film more than ten years ago and things change and now Nikita is not that cruel movie anymore.<br /><br />I came back to re-watch Nikita after a lecture I heard about spontaneity and creativity. The speaker cited Nikita as an example for spontaneity. He told about the scene when Nikita gets the guns in the red box as a present and is told to kill a man behind her in the restaurant, run out of the room, look for the men's toilet, check the last cabinet and climb out on the small window there with place only for a women of her size to get through; the car is waiting for her for 5 minutes outside. Nikita does as told, shoots, runs, searches, opens the window - but then the windows is walled. And here starts spontaneity - what to do now? In fact, I watched the entire movie to see this scene - wow I learned again something!<br /><br />Otherwise, Nikita is rather a 'sweet action movie' by my standards of today. The storyline is interesting, the playing is OK, just the whole is unpolished and a bit rough to me. However, no question, back then, this movie was the starter for a whole series of story lines and Luc Besson merits credit for his originality. 7/10\",\n",
       " \"This is the most violent film I have ever seen. I don't particularly like violent films, I'm not a huge action fan, and I dislike thrillers. But I was completely spellbound by this film.<br /><br />I've never left another theater and found myself walking with my back to the wall.<br /><br />There are other films with more blood and gore, more dead bodies, more gunshots, and more action. But for sheer cold violence - Victor, Nettoyer - nothing comes close to La Femme Nikita.* And the violence doesn't stop at the physical - it continues down burrowing down into the psychology. <br /><br />But the reasons it is so good are not so easy to identify. <br /><br />There may be clues in the many spin-offs and remakes may provide some clues - because none of them are remotely close. So it can't be purely the story, or the premise. And other actors with arguably more experience haven't delivered on the role, so it's not solely the acting (or actors).<br /><br />And there are some aspects of the production that are distinctly unpromising - in particular the fact that the director created the film purely as a vehicle to allow (girlfriend?) Parillaud to break out of the stereotype straight-jacket she was sewn into by her prior roles. There's no doubt Peraud is attractively packaged, and for males at least the role could create a fatal fascination with the female spider. But dropping other attractive actresses into hot roles is usually a guarantee of mediocrity or comic-strip soft porn.<br /><br />Perhaps the foreign language helps to make the other world both more exotic, yet more believable at the same time? But there must be far more to it than that.<br /><br />So often directors, writers, actors and studios set out to make a 'great' film, and despite all the money, talent and attention, it goes nowhere special.<br /><br />Yet on some less promising evening, all the stars and planets align on cue: The story may be discomforting, the violence offensive, actors and directors you have never heard of, in a language you cannot understand - but you are absolutely transfixed.<br /><br />There are some weak points to the film, particularly in the early going, where belief is stretched too thin before you are drawn down into another world. It is unfortunate because these probably could have been avoided, and the film would have approached perfection. It would be nice to give it a 10, but it's not there.<br /><br />But even as it is, I find it amazing that a film can be so good as to make me love something I don't like.<br /><br />You may not enjoy this film. You may not approve of this film. You might not sleep easily after this film. But you will feel as though you have seen truly great cinema.<br /><br />The downside? Films like this make run-of-the-mill TV and movies impossible to waste your time watching.<br /><br />*Except perhaps Pulp Fiction, but the spider's web there was more coarsely spun.\",\n",
       " 'When I first set out to try and use film to help me with learning French, it was a completely uncharted territory except for one title I had heard of previously: La Femme Nikita. This film was such a success that it went on to fare well in the U.K. and the States, which is always an achievement for a subtitled film, was later remade in Hollywood as Point of No Return and then finally as a TV series.<br /><br />It starts very suddenly with a girl, we will come to know as Nikita, involved in a drugged-out store robbery that lands her in jail. Probably from the fact that she has nothing to lose, she is chosen to be removed from prison and entered into training as an assassin for the French DGSE (think CIA). As she goes from drug-addicted street trash to secret agent, we watch her remain steadfastly defiant in her original style until her handler reaches through to her and she begins to accept her new life and allows herself to be tamed. The central theme of the movie is Nikita and her reactions to her continually changing fortunes, so this tamed peace rapidly transitions across rejection, freedom, love, manipulation, terror and eventually selfless sacrifice (I\\'ve given away nothing!). Throughout her experience, a common thread in many of these phases, and often the catalyst for them, her handler, is the source of her most complex relationship. Their interactions carry tones of unrequited and forbidden love which drive him to cruelty toward her to punish himself and drive her to frigidness and rebellion against him. In many ways, the cloak-and-dagger moves, secret organizations and gun battles are just window dressings for that relationship. Thankfully, there is much more in relationships and \"window dressing\" to keep us riveted and thinking throughout this movie.',\n",
       " 'One of the hallmarks of a good European film is that it gets to be re-made in Hollywood. Director/Producer/Writer Luc Besson has received this dubious honour twice, firstly with a remake of \"Nikita\" and more recently with one of \"Taxi\".<br /><br />I can\\'t comment on the American version of \"Taxi\", but the remake of \"Nikita\", known as \"Point of No Return\" or \"The Assassin\", isn\\'t a patch on the original. <br /><br />\"Nikita\" made me feel sympathy for the central characters, to the extent that I was almost in tears at times. The story is a simple one of love and longing to be free, interspersed with Besson\\'s trademark economical-yet-bloody action scenes.<br /><br />\"Nikita\" proves that there is more to Cinema than Hollywood.',\n",
       " '... Let\\'s get the basics out of the way, first. \"Nikita\" is a good film; with all of the visual flourishes and compelling mood that it seems can be found in the bulk of Besson\\'s work. If you are coming to this review BEFORE having seen \"Leon\" (\"The Professional\") then my best advice is just to disregard the rest of what follows and take \"Nikita\" on its own terms. Hope you enjoy it!<br /><br />* (COMPARISON WITH \\'LEON\\' - RISK OF SPOILERS FOR BOTH FILMS!) ... I know there is some debate amongst film fans over which constitutes the most satisfying experience. Personally; I\\'d have to pick \"Leon\". Disregarding the sex of the character, \"Leon\" as an enterprise is like a more \\'plush\\' version of Besson\\'s 1990 assassin effort. It\\'s like a before and after snapshot; Leon\\'s pretty much \\'compartmentalized\\' his life - Nikita\\'s struggling to get a grip on hers...<br /><br />Perhaps \"Leon\" represents the evolution of Besson\\'s \\'paternal\\' instinct; as he watches his own children grow. There is certainly a greater degree of patience shown from outside influences in Mathilda\\'s case, as opposed to Nikita... The original street kid is the quintessential animal; and although we are shown what instigates her partial transformation, her support system is never quite as convincingly \\'solid\\' as that provided by Leon and Tony...<br /><br />I suppose the tension bubbling under the surface does provide a comedic highlight; as Marco lies dreamily on the bed and coos to his supposedly \\'docile\\' mate that he didn\\'t know what he\\'d come across when he first met her - cut to our heroine assembling a gun in the bathroom... Guess what, mate; you STILL don\\'t... ! <br /><br />Having more \\'rounded\\' characters with less rough edges DID make it easier for me to become \\'emotionally involved\\', though. Would Leon have opened the door for Mathilda if he hadn\\'t been schooled by someone with perhaps similar thought processes to Bob?? In Leon we see the individual that \"Nikita\" would like to become by obtaining her freedom...<br /><br />Those who prefer to dispassionately study people and their actions from a distance might just retain a softer spot for \"Nikita\". It\\'s certainly interesting to speculate on what motivated the changes in his later work, though... !',\n",
       " \"On paper, Nikita doesn't sound to promising. In the wrong hands, the idea of a criminal being trained to become a top assassin sounds like a story that would be campy, ridiculous, and over-the-top, almost comic book like. Luckily, Nikita was in the right hands as the end result is way better than expected. The script is well written, the cinematography is beautiful, and the directing is exciting more often than not. That said, what ultimately makes Nikita work as well as it does is lead Anne Parillaud as Nikita. Parillaud doesn't have much dialogue in the first act. This leaves her to do most of her acting with facial expressions. With a lesser actress, this could have been disastrous. However, Parillaud is a strong actress and is able to pull the role off well. Perhaps it is due to her lack of dialogue that I find the first half of the picture far superior to the second half.<br /><br />Once Nikita's relationship with Marco begins, the film loses the same momentum it once had. This shift in tone is necessary to some extent in order to show Nikita is able to love and be human. At the same time, the result makes the film feel a bit uneven. The romance-filled middle almost feels like it belongs in another movie altogether. The romance is helped by the good performances, but the tone isn't quite right. It's a problem that probably could have been fixed in the editing process. It would be fascinating to see another cut of Nikita, one where the romance is drastically edited with scenes rearranged and maybe a few minutes taken out. For me, that would be a better version. I'm sure there are people who find the romantic segments the best part of Nikita. I am not one of them.<br /><br />There was never a sequel to Nikita, but the ending leaves room for one. Obviously too much time has gone by for a sequel to be made now, though I can picture one that begins right as Nikita ends. The perfect ending provides enough closure for the audience to be satisfied and just enough room for more. The ending is often the most important part in any storytelling medium, be it literature, theater, or film. The wrong ending can leave an audience frustrated. The wrong ending can even ruin the entire experience for an audience. With Nikita, Luc Besson has given the audience the most suitable ending, one that is completely satisfying. Nikita may not be perfect, though the material in the beginning and the end is so strong that only middle section prevents it from being a perfect movie.\",\n",
       " \"This is probably one of the best spy/action dramas ever made. It tells the history of a heroin junkie who has incredible killing capacities and fakes her death for becoming a government assassin. Luc Besson's Nikita has all: It has action, it has drama, tragedy, and even black humor (Victor the cleaner says it all) It is with a good script (few holes) a very good direction, excellent performances in everyone, thrilling music. It's the thing that James Bond never did Classic<br /><br />Just one of the best. This shows while it then had an American version, but it's not worth it. The character of Nikita is golden build, as the others, and the performance by the leading actress is amazing.<br /><br />Nikita<br /><br />Just Nikita\",\n",

Anne Parillaud, Marc Duret, Patrick Fontana are outstanding.<br /><br />This is a pretty violent movie, but not just for the sake of violence,it is a necessary counter-point to Nikkita's blossoming appreciation of life.The violence is realistic and well done.<br /><br />The action scene's are fast pasted and tense.<br /><br />Everything about this film is top notch, I recommend it.\",\n",

       " 'This Nikita\\'s Too Thin<br /><br />Unlike the `Nikita\\' (as in, former USSR premier) and, like it\\'s leading lady, LA FEMME NIKITA is too thin to be as fully satisfying or thought provoking as it could have been. As written by Luc Besson and as played by Anne Parillaud , Nikita is a whiney, drug addicted psychopath who murders a police officer in cold blood, even though she has virtually no chance of escape. Even during incarceration, Nikita ruthlessly maims an interrogator. She is sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 30 years.<br /><br />CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />When Nikita finds herself being summarily executed by lethal injection, she cries out for her mama. This cowardly behavior was found repugnant in the days of Cagney and Bogart. Here, I suppose, it is suppose to arouse sympathy for Nikita. It doesn\\'t work.<br /><br />Nikita awakes to find that her execution and burial has been staged, and her new mentor, Bob (Tchéky Karyo) recruits her for work as a spy / assasin. Bob gives her one hour to choose: Either work for us or be executed for real.<br /><br />Using a ruse, Nikita attacks Bob and, taking his weapon, uses Bob as a shield in an attempt to escape. When her plans are foiled, Nikita attempts suicide, but Bob has left the first chamber in his gun empty. Reclaiming his weapon, Bob shoots Nikita in the leg as a lesson. This is the first scene in the movie I actually enjoyed.<br /><br />Entering training, the cruel, unruly Nikita physically injures one trainer and emotionally injures another. Bob finds out from Nikita it is her TWENTIETH birthday. Bringing Nikita a cake, he tells her she has two weeks or she\\'ll never see 21. Visiting her `feminity\\' instructor (Jeanne Moreau), Nikita begins to learn to use her feminine gifts. <br /><br />After finishing her makeup, throughout which Moreau says, `You are going to be very late!\\' Nikita goes to celebrate her TWENTY-THIRD birthday with Bob! After three years, the only apparent changes in Nikita are that she is slightly calmer (Ritalin?) and has learn to brush her teeth, comb her hair and apply makeup (your tax francs at work\\x85)<br /><br />Her birthday celebration outside the facility (which she hasn\\'t left in three years), turns out to be an assassination in a public restaurant. This is the best action sequence in the movie (and Parillaud performs many of her own stunts). However, it seems pretty silly for an `expert\\' spy to leave a `novice\\' spy to commit this kind of mayhem in such a public place.<br /><br />It gets worse. Once Nikita escapes and returns to the spy compound, making no attempt to hide her tracks, Bob tells her that she is `free\\' and that the organization has set her up with a cover. Right, she has just slaughtered over a half dozen people in a public place and she is free to go settle down. What, is there no police force in France (I guess Nikita killed the last cop in the beginning). Nikita then becomes domesticated and settles in with a sweet boyfriend, Marco (Jean-Hugues Anglade). Things are going swimmingly for Nikita until the `nasty organization\\' asks her to do a few more jobs, each one more ridiculous than the rest. One asks us believe that Nikita could shoot a woman with a high powered rifle from her motel room and have no police come to investigate. The last would have us believe that Nikita dressed as as a male diplomat could ride through the gates of an embassy with a heavily armed hit man whom looks nothing like the real ambassador\\'s driver without being questioned. It also asks us to believe a car can crash through a solid brick wall and keep on going.<br /><br />Near the end of the movie, Marco, whom has discovered whom Nikita is, debates with Bob about the moral equivalency of Nikita\\'s assassinations of enemies of the state with her murder of the innocent cop. Some have argued this movie makes a strong statement against capital punishment. I disagree. Nikita may no longer be as rebellious, but she is every bit as dangerous at the end of the movie as she was at the beginning. She NEVER shows remorse for the cop\\'s murder, and always seems only concerned about saving her own skin. Her only sacrifice seems to be abandoning the two men she loves. Will Nikita again become the foul, ruthless, drug-addicted `wild child\\' of the streets. The liberal conceit that `society made her that way\\' and that, \"love and financial security will save her\" fails to take into account the Robert Downey Juniors and O.J. Simpson\\'s of the world. Certainly external forces DO shape us, but they don\\'t make us whom we are. That kind of wooly-headed thinking is why so many FAVOR capital punishment. That is, in order to prevent nitwit social scientists from inflicting the same murderer on us TWICE. Besides, the organization would track down and kill Nikita to protect itself from exposure. Nikita would understand. After all, the organization would be playing by HER rules.<br /><br />This movie is wrong headed from the start. Luc Besson\\'s trademark `flying dolly\\' opening shot into strutting drug-addicted criminals does not work here. Drug addicts, particularly those planning to rob a store would skulk, not strut. Thin stuff, indeed.<br /><br />',\n",

       " \"La Femme Nikita is one of the best action/thriller spy movies to come out in the 90's. Luc Besson became a name upon moviegoers lips from that moment.<br /><br />From the films brutal introduction to nerve racking ending, this film is, in my opinion, one of the greatest commercial french films. A great deal of people believe that French films have to be boring or art house. Well this movie has adrenaline but also has a interesting imagery to it. the characters and supporting characters are all stylish with each underlining imagery that go with them.<br /><br />Example. When our heroine goes on her first mission she meets her team. The team is filled with men with earings, dreadlocks and even ganger looks. These agents do not resemble the clean cut, tuxedo wearing James Bond. there is also a mixture of cultures which i find refreshing.<br /><br />Even the action is stylistic. Luc Besson created the camera POV of the bullets trajectory (which was i believe was stolen by Robin Hood : Prince of thieves 1991).<br /><br />La Femme Nikita is much better than its boring American remake POINT OF NO RETURN ( the movie was good enough to be shown in the States without having to be remade).<br /><br />I Recommend this movie to whom ever are in the mood for a good story and a great set of action sequences.\",\n",
       " \"This is a pretty good sequel for the most part that's quite entertaining, with fantastic performances, however it comes nowhere close to matching the original. All the characters are pretty cool, and the story was solid, plus Emily Perkins is simply amazing in this!. I was really disappointed that Katharine Isabelle was so wasted in this as she only has a few lines, and I thought Tatiana Maslany was brilliant as the psycho Ghost as she was really creepy and unpredictable, plus it had quite a few tense scenes. while it is good it just didn't have the magic the 1st did, and while the ending is really quite surprising, I never did care too much for it,plus Emily is able to match her amazing performance in the 1st!. It's decently made and written, and it also leaves open the possibility of another sequel which I would love to see, however like the 1st the Werewolf effects Wern't that great. There is a freaky masturbation scene, and I love the setting in the creepy hospital, plus all the characters were quite likable. This is a pretty good sequel for the most part that's quite entertaining with fantastic performances, however it comes nowhere near close to matching the original in my opinion, still I highly recommend it. The Direction is quite good!. Brett Sullivan does quite a good job here with effective camera work, solid angles, using a creepy setting, adding creepy atmosphere some good POV shots, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a fast pace for the most part.<br /><br />There is a bit of blood and gore. We get bloody self mutilation, bloody werewolf attacks, glimpses of pretty gory corpses, skin cut off of someone's ear, nasty transformation scenes, hammer in the head (at least I think it was), quite a bit of blood, and other minor stuff.<br /><br />The Acting is fantastic!. Emily Perkins is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely likable, tough but vulnerable, had pretty good chemistry with Tatiana Maslany, is incredibly gorgeous, was quite intense, and you will really care for her character, she really did match her amazing performance in the 1st here, and it will be very interesting to see what her character will be like if they make a true sequel to this (full Werewolf?) (Perkins Rules!!!!!!!). Tatiana Maslany is brilliant as Ghost, she played the creepy psycho very well yet she still managed to be quite likable, she was also energetic had some good lines, had a wicked character, and was totally unpredictable, I predict big things for this young actress!. Eric Johnson is great as Tyler he was a bit of an ass and very cocky, but somehow yet still charming and quite likable I dug him for some reason, he did a good job. Janet Kidder is decent as Alice and did what she had to do adequately. Katharine Isabelle is still gorgeous as ever, but had only a few scenes was totally wasted! which was incredibly disappointing, I mean it was great to see her but I began thinking why did she even agree to make a few appearances with minimal dialog?. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend it. ***1/2 out of 5\",\n",
       " 'So just to recap the events of the original \"Ginger Snaps\" (SPOILERS!!!), Ginger and Brigette are sisters ... Ginger is bitten by a werewolf ... Ginger begins to turn into a werewolf ... Brigette infects herself with Ginger\\'s blood ... Brigette kills Ginger.<br /><br />We rejoin Brigette after an undisclosed period of time. She\\'s living in a cheap motel room in a city somewhere, shooting up on wolfsbane and keeping a chart of how long it takes for self-inflicted wounds to heal -- hoping against hope that she might never become a werewolf. Occasionally she is visited by the ghost of her dead sister, who haunts and taunts her throughout the movie (you can\\'t have a Ginger Snaps movie without a Ginger, right?). One night she manages to overdose on wolfsbane, and she gets picked up and taken to an outreach centre where she is kept caged like an animal and deprived of the drug ... but what they don\\'t know is that she\\'s being hunted by another deadly werewolf, who has a strong desire to mate with her.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps : Unleashed is even darker than the original, both in the metaphorical and in the literal sense of the word. It\\'s also a lot weirder ... so if, like me, you\\'re a big fan of weird, odds are you\\'ll probably lap this up like a bloodthirsty wolf.

Eric Johnson and the young Tatiana Maslany both deliver superb performances in the two main supporting roles. In most respects, many agree that this sequel is in fact better than the first movie ... but they\\'re both so great, I don\\'t even feel the need to compare them.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about the fact that this wasn\\'t written by the same team as the first movie (in fact screenwriter Megan Martin seems to have no other credits to her name), but it is actually an interesting twist on the original, written by someone who clearly understood what Ginger Snaps was all about. There are two main formulaic werewolf plots ... the first involves our hero changing into a werewolf, which will eventually lead either to finding a cure or to their death (as in the first movie), and the second is about a group of characters being stalked by a werewolf, and for an added twist perhaps the werewolf is one of them. This film incorporates both of these formulas into an excellent, engaging horror story.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps is probably the first great werewolf movie to have a worthy sequel, and if that wasn\\'t enough they had to go and do it again a third time. If you haven\\'t seen this whole trilogy yet, you definitely should.',\n",

       " \"This sequel picks up shortly after the first film ends. We meet Brigitte in a Despair Montage. You know the sort I mean -- clips of ostensibly mundane images edited together with some heavy music, to indicate a wretched emotional state. Brigitte is alone and clearly desperate. She looks and sounds like a junkie. Which she is -- though not for your standard drugs. After an incident which is probably not hallucinatory -- but which the film leaves deliberately ambiguous, since Brigitte has just o.d.'d -- Brigitte is consigned to a rehab clinic.<br /><br />Now, I don't know anything about the day-to-day realities of the Canadian public health system. But I seriously doubt that anything is as creepy and weird and unsettlingly earnest as this place. The halfway house director, Alice, is a very fine character. Played by Canadian actress Janet Kidder, Alice is surprisingly three-dimensional for her cardboard role. Kudos to Kidder. I mean, really. The Rehab Director Who Won't Believe You is kinda a feature of these sorts of films.<br /><br />All right, I'm going to digress.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about horror movies is the part which no-one thought about. In the creation of a horror film, the screenwriters and directors think about many things. Dialog. Cineamatography. Score. Special FX. MPAA ratings. Coolness. One of the least thought-about items in most cases is the backstory of the plot. Horror starts with a Bad Thing Happening. The audience is given a vague series of hand-waving gestures as to how the Bad Thing came to be, and that's it. It is the least important thing.<br /><br />Which makes it incredibly interesting to me. What happens, see, is that the writers reach for something easy for the audience. For example. In the 1960's everything was a result of leaked radiation. In the late 1970's and early 1980's everything was caused by premarital sex and psychological obsessions. In the 1930's everything was caused by travelling to foreign places and meeting weird people.<br /><br />The first causes of things in horror films are facile glosses of cultural fears. That's point one.<br /><br />The second things that interests me in horror films is who the real villain is. Not the monster, or the bad guy, or the alien who eats your face. Who is the one that does the human-scale evil that leads to the ultimate disaster. The real, understandable villain. In Nightmare on Elm Street the real villain was and is always the parents who murdered Fred Krueger and who subsequently refused to aid their children in any way with the consequences of their actions. In Psycho it's Norman's mother, who twisted him so awfully. In Scream 3 (and this is stretching the point a bit -- but only a bit) it's Hollywood, for how it eats its actors alive.<br /><br />The third thing that I love about horror films is the pretext for helplessness. The protagonists is always helpless for much of the film. Why? Is the villain all-powerful? Are they trapped in a spaceship? Does society refuse to believe them? Are massive corporations hiding the evidence? What strips the protagonists of their power? Or, did they have any power in the first place? (Which, box office dynamics aside, is one reason why horror films feature teens. They have agency and some power, but never, ever enough.) In terms of the things that interest me, Unleashed scores quite high. Birgitte is stripped of her power in two ways. First, she is degrading from within due to the disease. Second, her means of controlling herself is taken away by being locked in rehab. The real villain in the film I will NOT tell you. But. The entire message of the film is one of the nature of human response to internal evil.<br /><br />I'll say that again.<br /><br />Werewolf movies are always about how you choose to deal with your internal evil.<br /><br />Which leads me to the most interesting thing about horror movies, the thoughtless choice of first causes. Yes, yes, hot werewolf chicks are cool. We all know this. Whatever. I'm not talking about that. The first film was about what happens when the powerless get power. But the parallel message of GS was that power does not grant you license to do what you darn well please. GS:U continues that second theme.<br /><br />Brigitte simply refuses to give in to everything she wants, though she knows it's hopeless. Though she is attacked from inside her own self. Attacked by what she wants more than anything in the world. Her own desires are her enemy.<br /><br />So why make a movie with this theme? I think that once a theme is identified in a horror film, all one has to do to answer why is look around at the culture. I don't really know what Canadian anxieties are right now. So my guess is that this film is playing off of societal fears of Canada being infected by the cultural madness of the US, which fosters some of people's secret worst desires and makes them something to be proud of. Religious zealotry and intolerance, xenophobia, and warmongering disguised as patriotism are all things I think Canadians are culturally nervous about. As well as a fear/pride ambivalence -- they think they are strong enough to withstand our cultural imperialism, but are a little afraid that maybe, secretly, they'll like it and give in.<br /><br />Infected with a disease that forces you to revel in everything you hate in yourself. Sounds like a werewolf flick to me.\",\n",
       " 'In the long history of cinema, not many sequels have been of the highest quality. And while \"Ginger Snaps II\" is not better than the original, I\\'m proud to have it as a sequel to one of my favorite horror movies of all time. And as a Canadian, I\\'m very proud that our filmmakers are capable of making a horror franchise that maintains not only the scare-factor, but also a lot of much-needed dignity.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Brigitte is on the run from the events of the first movie. The monkshood drug that saved Jason in the first movie is apparently not permanently effective, and she has to take it repeatedly to stop the transformation. A werewolf is searching for her (presumably Jason from the first movie transformed from not taking more monskhood), and wants to mate with her. When Brigitte is found unconscious on the street carrying syringes and monskhood, she\\'s taken to a rehab clinic for drug-abusers.<br /><br />This movie is very different from the first one. Brigitte\\'s transformation is very different from Ginger\\'s. She keeps having visions of Ginger, who tries to tell her that the inevitable is, in fact, inevitable. The strong characters remain in this entry. Ghost could not be creepier, and Tyler could not be more of a jerk. But what impressed me about this movie was that it still managed to be scary. Very close, in fact, to the first movie. The suspense is strong, and the use of dead silence is perfectly executed. And, like the first movie, I was happy not to see a drop of CGI throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />I was lucky enough to win free passes to see this movie two days earlier than everyone else, and boy am I glad. I can\\'t say I have any real problem with this movie. It\\'s quite excellent. The first movie is better because...it\\'s the first one. That\\'s all I can say.<br /><br />8/10',\n",
       " 'This movie was absolutely the best werewolf movie ever made! It was so good, that, if I didn\\'t have a short attention span, I would watch it back-to-back every day!<br /><br />First of all, the acting, once again, was superb. Emily Perkins does a wonderful job as Brigitte, and the new character, Ghost, was perfect, although her lines seemed a little too rehearsed. <br /><br />I really like the dark humor in it, once again. I like movies that can be dramatic, somewhat scary, and funny all at once (all movies should be!). I don\\'t know how people can say that they don\\'t like this movie. I do!<br /><br />The ending, where Ghost traps the transforming Brigitte in her cellar, and then welcomes her grandma home, is perfectly dark. I kinda think it\\'s mean that she wants to hurt her grandma, but it goes with the plot. I especially like the very end, when she\\'s reading the comic, and she says something like, \"And off she went on her reign of terror, to vanquish her mortal enemies, of which there were many.\"<br /><br />I don\\'t know why I like it so much, it\\'s just perfect.',\n",
       " 'Title: Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed <br /><br />Director: Brett Sullivan <br /><br />Cast: Emily Perkins, Katherine Isabelle, Tatiana Maslany, Eric Johnson <br /><br />Tagline: It only dies if you do <br /><br />Review: After having enjoyed the first Ginger Snaps immensely I decided to check out the sequel which had the same to actresses who played sisters on the last film. Did it live up to the coolness of the original? Well no, to be honest.<br /><br />The story follows Bridgette who after being bitten by her own sister on the last film is now also suffering the painful and slow process of becoming a werewolf. She uses a drug to help slow down the process, but how long will it last? Not a lot of time passes until she ends up in a rehab center and befriends a bunch of messed up junkie girls. The authorities believe that Bridgette is just a junkie in need of some serious rehabilitation. The girls she meets in the center are similar to the group of screwed up kids seen in Nightmare on Elm Street III: The Dream Warriors.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie was its look. It was well shot and had some stylish camera angles...also some of the characters were very very likable. Like for example the little girl who plays \"ghost\" she was an interesting character and one of the coolest things about the movie. She quickly befriends Bridgette due to the fact that she doest have many friends. I liked her right of the bat just cause she reads and constantly quotes her horror comics. The character of Ghost is the only thing original that this movie has to offer, aside from her and the sub plot with her grandmother, there\\'s nothing new in Ginger Snaps 2.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that for the longest time it just draaaags. The whole movie is just about one thing. Teasing you. You keep thinking that eventually your going to see Bridgette transform. Many times through out the film she is found in exactly the same situation...just seconds away from transforming...but then she takes that drug and everything goes back to normal. Its like watching an episode of the Hulk in which Bruce Banner never transforms into the hulking beast. For a long time...nothing really happens. The movie just stretches to the point of boredom. Until the last 15 minutes of course.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a werewolf movie, yet there\\'s hardly any werewolf action. We only get to see one werewolf and hes hidden in shadows and quick cuts. I wished we could have seen more of the creature we came to see. Could it be that the director is afraid of showing his low budget creature? Hmm..at leas the first one showed the werewolf even if it wasn\\'t the best looking one, it was there.<br /><br />Sadly we only get to see katherine Isabelle in a small cameo, she was a huge part in what made the first one so much fun, here shes just a watcher, a character who really does nothing except comment on what she sees and torments Bridgette. The chemistry between the two sisters which was in a large part what made the first one so enjoyable is completely gone! That sucked big time for me.<br /><br />In conclusion this movie had some good characters, a monster that wouldn\\'t show and some nice camera shots. Gone is the chemistry between Bridgette and Ginger and the punch that the first movie had. I don\\'t get whey there\\'s so many positive reviews for this film it was alright, but sadly not as good as the first.<br /><br />Rating: 21/2 out of 5',\n",
       " \"I thought this movie was brilliant. I am a huge fan of the Ginger Snaps series and I think this one is amazing. This film is mainly about Brigitte, as the first one was mainly about Ginger. Although Ginger does appear for a few minutes in some bits of the movie, Brigitte has the majority of the movie. Some may be disappointed as Ginger is gone, but Brigitte is very good in her role which makes up for Ginger's absence. Emily Perkins, in my opinion, plays Brigitte Fitzgerald far better in this movie than the first. For one, she has real hair now. Secondly, Brigitte has a huge contrast to the other character in the movie, which attracts you to her dark personality more. One of those attracted is the comic book obsessed Ghost, who is fascinated by the mysterious sister and wants to know more about her. But Brigitte being Brigitte, she's become very anti-social. Ghost is a strange girl. She doesn't seem to be able to divide the comic book world from the real world, which can make her annoying as she seems to go on about darkness and such. She's a chatterbox, and is constantly pestering Brigitte, wondering what she is hiding from everyone. The werewolves in Ginger Snaps II: Unleashed were far better than the original Ginger Snaps movie. These werewolves have developed from the weird pink things they were before and now have fur, proper fangs and scary yellow eyes! I would recommend this movie to whoever liked the first one. It's got a bit less gore and more sexual references, but the darkness of Brigitte's role and the weird Ghost makes this film amazing. *10*\",\n",
       " 'The original Ginger Snaps was a refreshing take on the werewolf story - the way that it blended the similarities in the story with the puberty of teenage girls was both amusing and original and it proved that there was still some originality left in the genre. This first sequel isn\\'t quite as good as the original, but there\\'s still much to like about it. The story follows Brigitte, the more weird and less sexy of the two sisters from the first film who is now changing into a werewolf herself. For some reason that is never properly explained, she has infected herself with the curse via Ginger\\'s blood and has gotten herself addicted to the cure, the plant; monkshood, in order to stop herself changing into a werewolf like her sister did. However, all is not so simple, as another werewolf is on the rampage and is stalking Brigitte because it wants to...ahem, mate with her. After surviving an attack from it, Brigitte is picked up by the police and taken to a rehabilitation clinic where she meets a whole host of new characters, including, most notably, a young weirdo called Ghost.<br /><br />Making a welcome return from the first film is the parallels that are drawn between turning into a werewolf and being a teenager. It\\'s not put forward as forcefully as it was in the original and it seems to concentrate more on the drug taking tearaway side of being a teenager as opposed to the more normal side. There is significantly less humour in this outing, as the parents that delivered most of it last time round have been dropped, but one thing I did find rather amusing was the way that the film used the wolf that wants to mate with Brigitte: probably a commentary on hormonal young men. Unfortunately, Katherine Isabelle who played Ginger in the original film isn\\'t in this film as much as most viewers would like, and she serves the plot in more of an advisory capacity (much like the ghost in American Werewolf in London) and this doesn\\'t allow her much screen time (although this will hopefully be rectified in the prequel; Ginger Snaps Back). One thing that this film definitely has over the original is the werewolf effects; they were terrible in the first film and really let it down, but here they seem to have taken influence from Dog Soldiers and look much better for it.<br /><br />The new cast of characters don\\'t make up for the relative loss of Ginger, but nevertheless; they\\'re largely well done. Ginger\\'s \"replacement\" is the aforementioned young girl, known as \\'Ghost\\'. Ghost is an interesting character, and despite being a child; doesn\\'t manage to become annoying, which is rare. The other two main characters are a male nurse, and a drugs councillor, both of which serve as metaphors for different roles in teenage life. What sets this film apart from many modern day horror films of this nature is that it\\'s story driven, and rather restrained in the gore department. The film also has an atmosphere of tragedy throughout. This is one of the things I liked best about the original; the dark and morbidity of what\\'s happening on screen consolidates with the characters, and are almost an extension of those characters; which also serves in giving the film a degree of intelligence.<br /><br />The tragedy of the first film was brought to a head by way of it\\'s brilliant and heartbreaking ending, and this film would have to work hard if it was even going to attempt at topping it. It didn\\'t top it - the ending here, although good, and very imaginative isn\\'t as well done as the idea suggests it could have been; and that\\'s a shame. Other than that, however; this is one of the best horror sequels in a long time, and comes with the highest recommendation.',\n",
       " \"Respectable, even impressive follow-up to the sharp-witted Canadian horror indie. This one doesn't have the sustained thematic focus of the first, but all in all it's as twisted, watchable, and occasionally amusing as fans of the series would hope. If Emily Perkins's performance doesn't blow us away as it did in `Ginger Snaps,' that's only because it's not as much of a surprise this time around, and Tatiana Maslany's Ghost makes a goofy but plausible addition to the films' world. As I said, it's not the out-and-out allegory that the first film was, but there are rich satiric moments, flashes of wit (Brigitte's discovery of her hairy palms comes to mind), and nice nods to werewolf-movie convention, with the finale taking place in a remote cabin in the snowy woods. There are a few problems too--a weak, TV-ish performance by Eric Johnson, completely unnecessary cameos by Ginger herself, and worst of all an unfair and somewhat sad shift of focus at the end. But these things don't really diminish `Ginger Snaps 2's' accomplishments, and it remains an entertaining and original new horror film--a very rare thing these days. 7.5 out of 10.\",\n",
       " \"Wow. What a great flick. I daresay it may even be better than the original. I say may, because the final scenes are a bit of an unnecessary letdown considering the buildup. While at first I thought I would miss Ginger, I realized her parts in this were pretty superfluous and could've been left out, since Bridgette was very capable of handling the film on her own. Of course then you couldn't have matching DVD covers. Atmosphere is way ramped up on this one (even the opening credits gave me the creeps, ugh) and the soundtrack definitely adds to the dread. A few nice scares and gore shots. This one was much more depressing than the first, which in my book is never a bad thing.<br /><br />\",\n",
       " 'Loving \"Ginger Snaps\", a film which if you\\'re like me felt left too many unanswered questions, coming into \"Ginger Snaps 2\" I was eager to see not only how they answered the unanswered questions, but seeing if they could keep the name Ginger Snaps still alive. Well I suppose they did but only in spirit, but it could have been worse. If you\\'re reading this I\\'m assuming you\\'ve seen \"Ginger Snaps 1\" if not, goodbye thanks for reading. Anyways, I loved how the film was pretty much all about Bridgette, not that hated Ginger it\\'s just I really didn\\'t want to deal with one of the problems with Ginger Snaps 1 again which was the constant deal of: I\\'m okay, no I\\'m a wolf, No I\\'m okay, I hate you, now I don\\'t, Now I do! You know, it gets old fast, so therefore having a on woman show with Bridgette I liked. Overall Ginger Snaps 2 isn\\'t exactly a bad sequel, it\\'s just an attempt that was just a little too safe. Ginger Snaps took a risk, after just recovering from the Columbine Massacre and other uproars in teen violence, Ginger Snaps 1 could have been more appropriate, but they weren\\'t and it worked. Here with Ginger Snaps 2 there is no risk visible, and in the end this is probably how Ginger Snap 1 would have been if it had been safe. Sure I\\'ll admit a sequel to a cult classics like Ginger Snaps is a challenge enough, but as a sequel I think it should want to be better, but here it feels more like they don\\'t want to offend anybody (being the fans) so they play it safe. I loved how for the beginning they truly focus on the aftermath of part 1 (which is the funnest part of sequels, just getting to say \"Hey I was there I saw that with you!\" is fun), because it\\'s fun to continue with the story from part 1. However as it descends from that it just becomes boring, and just like any other face in the crowd, and doesn\\'t really have anything newer or anything to make it stand out like Ginger Snaps did. Perhaps the main thing is how they make certain characters bigger characters than they truly need to be. Ghost being the biggest example, she was annoying, to desperate, and honestly needed to die. Pretty much after Bridgette and Ghost escape the hospital is where it gets bad. All in all it\\'s not exactly a bad movie it\\'s just it\\'s nothing special, even if it weren\\'t a preceded sequel to Ginger Snaps, and like I said it\\'s very safe. Besides even still as a sequel there are still too many unanswered questions, and don\\'t even get me started on that ending. If you\\'re a fan of Ginger Snaps, I\\'d see this one only too say you saw it.',\n",
       " 'I am a die hard fan of the original Ginger Snaps, and this sequel is like having to use Windows 3.1 my whole life. I tried to allow for the curse of high expectations. What I did not expect was that this movie would raise them by starting with an excellent, original story concept, good music, an edgy atmosphere and a solid gold performance by Emily Perkins. Those are the only things I can recommend about this film, however, and half of those are thrown out midway through the story.<br /><br />The film\\'s downfall is the screenplay, which was written by Megan Martin, who apparently had no previous screen writing experience. True, Karen Walton, who wrote the original (with director John Fawcett) also had no experience, but she also worked on that script for four years. It is harder to write for somebody else\\'s character creations. For a sequel to a successful movie with a fan base, only chintziness could explain hiring a first-time writer for the sequel.<br /><br />So, with practically no help from the dialog, Perkins carries the entire first half of the film as the lonely, doomed Brigitte, bereft of Ginger, and bitterly fighting her own animalistic changes. The difference in Brigitte\\'s character after the traumas she suffered in the first movie are both believably sad and shocking, showing that Perkins is an actress of the highest caliber. When Brigitte is found unconscious on a street with needle and cut marks on her arms, authorities assume she is a junkie and put her into a teen rehab center. It turned out that monkshood did not cure the curse, it simply delays it. So, she is trapped and can\\'t prevent her transformation in a place where she endangers many people, and, of course, the staff doesn\\'t believe her.<br /><br />From this mind-blowing story-concept we go to tedium, as the movie puts 75 minutes of material into 90 minutes. Midway through, it comes to life briefly, and then changes directions giving up everything it had going for it. Martin had written Brigitte into a corner, and so changed subject. I must admit here that I did not like the approach of dooming Brigitte from the beginning, and the twist at the end made me want to shoot the DVD as a traitor.<br /><br />Martin has made Brigitte far too restrained, including with people who would turn a Quaker homicidal. She only partially loses her temper once, and as a character noted, it was measured. Brundel\\'s law as it applies to werewolves is, there are no such thing as pacifist werewolves, or rather, any werewolf movie depicting them is a bomb. While Perkins does her best, in the many pauses in the dialog, depicting Brigitte as holding back her fury, it simply does not work in a werewolf movie, or in a horror movie. If the audience is asked to believe that a werewolf could be that restrained, they begin to doubt it is even a problem. <br /><br />Katharine Isabelle continues her role as Ginger, who is dead of course, and who only Brigitte can see. Isabelle only has about fifteen lines, though. These are the sorts of lines that can only be delivered in the sleepiest way possible, and it can\\'t be called dialog because usually Brigitte doesn\\'t answer. Isabelle\\'s part is almost all commentary and adds nothing to the plot. Her role seems half contractual obligation, half trailer-bait material. Mostly she just taunts Brigitte\\'s about her futile efforts to fight the curse. Of all people, Brigitte and Ginger should still have a lot to say to each other. This is a huge waste of an actress who showed her mettle in the original.<br /><br />No, instead, the movie is wrecked by Martin\\'s new character. Tatiana Maslani as \"Ghost\" does a good job as a mentally ill young girl, obsessed with comics. It\\'s a good character concept, really, and Maslani does do an excellent job. Even so, putting Ghost in and making her a major character respectively required an unbelievable explanation and an idiot plot. I felt like she belonged in her own movie and was just an intruder here. Worse, she crowded out a larger part for Katharine Isabelle, and the movie is called \"Ginger Snaps: Unleashed,\" right?<br /><br />Finally, I have to point out the werewolf makeup is BAD in this film. I never knew werewolves had sow\\'s ears and third-degree burns on their lips. At one point, they make Perkins look like Keith Richards, and by the end, she looks like an orc with an immobile mask so embarrassing that would have looked cheesy in the \\'60s. Except for the mask at the end, this is probably not the make-up artist\\'s fault. The makeup actually looks better on the DVD extras and in the publicity photos than it does in the movie. This suggests the problem was with the Lighting, the Director of Photography, or the Director. <br /><br />Nevertheless, the movie does get the special effects right for the fully animalized werewolf. <br /><br />Other fans of the original seem to like this movie, but I can\\'t help but see it as a major disappointment, though not a disaster. There was a much better story to be told here. Unlike the original, this did not have Karen Walton and four years of work on the screenplay. It fails on its own promise, too, and not only by the standards the original set for it.',\n",
       " \"I don't really need to say anything about the excellence in Emily's performance as Brigitte, do i, Katherine is also great as ever, in her best role, only rivaled by her little part in Freddy vs. Jason.<br /><br />but i wanted to talk a little about 'Ghost', played by 'young' Tatiana Maslany, i have written young in lines because when i watched the movie i thought, about 11 up to 14, not older, no way, but she was 19 at the time, unbelievable!!! but she was so very good as the little innocent girl ghost pretended to be and she kinda really looks like a little cute teenage girl, the kind you normally call friend of your little sister or some sort of that.<br /><br />and the twist at the end with ghost was just brilliant, because you always believed Tatiana her role, but there are a lot of clues earlier.<br /><br />There are some nice Gore effects in the werewolf victims, but it's never on a 'Braindead' level, so it always looks realistic, while Bridgets transformation is as great as Gingers in the first 1, kinda reminding of The Fly, not the original but the gory remake.<br /><br />overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.<br /><br />overall a great horror movie, with just enough suspense and gore to never get into the way of the story, at the beginning i thought, not a movie like Halloween 2 (great movie)again, were they just systematically wipe out some sort of hospital, but then she escapes and the story goes on and on, just good old story-telling like it should be.<br /><br />TAKE THAT Saw 3-5 (part 1 and 2 had good stories, but from part 3 onwards only Gore because they hadn't really much of a story to tell.\",\n",
       " 'Brigitte (Emily Perkins) destroyed the werewolf that was her sister at the end of the first movie. Now she\\'s infected with the same virus that\\'s slowly turning her, and she senses that another werewolf is on the prowl for her. After an encounter with the thing, she collapses in a snow bank to find herself awakening in and confined to a rehab clinic. And the werewolf is naturally still after her, while she continuously injects herself with monkshood to stave off her inevitable transformation.<br /><br />This intense and gruesome sequel is a worthy follow-up to the superb Canadian werewolf picture \"Ginger Snaps\". While it may not be completely satisfactory for viewers craving a high body count, it still piles on a fair bit of gore for prime visceral impact. It\\'s got some decent chase scenes and constantly creates a feeling of utter gloom. It\\'s not that there isn\\'t humor, but it\\'s largely of the dark variety, and the film-makers and cast play out their material with total conviction.<br /><br />What certainly helps is that the film looks as if it was filmed during an actual Canadian winter. Knowing full well just how cold and forbidding they can get, I believe it adds to the unrelenting atmosphere of the piece. The cinematography seems to deliberately shy away from most bright colors, and the tension is increased by the low-key but effective music score.<br /><br />There are some standout sequences. Life is clearly not easy for Brigitte; she finds that living life on her terms will come to be difficult and that she will have to make deals to get what she needs. Her late sister Ginger (the lovely Katharine Isabelle makes a welcome return appearance) appears in visions. The intelligent script draws the comparison between the curse of the werewolf and other ills of the young female demographic, and allows the film to refrain from being predictable. It gives Brigitte an offbeat young companion named \"Ghost\" (Tatiana Maslany) with whom she can share dialog and compare her own bleak world view; \"Ghost\" is a comic book addict and sees the werewolf persona as an appropriate antihero for a world beset by problems.<br /><br />One will also notice that with the possible exception of minor characters, not a single male individual on hand is sympathetic, thereby accenting the need for females to rely on each other.<br /><br />Co-starring are Janet Kidder (Margots\\' niece), Brendan Fletcher, and Eric Johnson, with each putting in a solid effort.<br /><br />The ending is an intriguing surprise and worth waiting for, and the film is overall a good entry in its series and a respectable addition to the canon of werewolf films.<br /><br />8/10',\n",

My time wouldn\\'t be so wasted as it was. And this movie was played at prime time on HBO Family!!!!!',\n",

With the exception(s) of two very lyrical dream sequences, there's absolutely nothing to recommend here. HAKAIDER calls to mind the American version of the GUYVER manganime, by way of ROBOCOP (which was itself nothing more than a thinly-veiled rip-off of the 2000 A.D. strip, JUDGE DREDD). Unlike ZEIRAM (or ZEIRAM 2) or TETSUO or any of a number of other well-done live-action anime, HAKAIDER offers nothing more than the aforementioned dream sequences; the rest is sound and fury signifying absolutely nothing. A major disappointment.\",\n",

There are very dynamic characters and excellent plot formation and culmination. The storyline is a very insightful view on humanity and socio-economic divisions and struggles therein. While touching these points and making an impact at doing so, the movie\\'s elements of action and drama are of such quality that anyone can enjoy the film without struggling to get it\\'s deeper meaning.

       " \"Don't get me wrong, there have been great westerns to come before Deadwood, but none of them really got it right. There is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and TV, we're finally starting to see the truth. David Milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west. Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time. Where do people think our language came from? People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.<br /><br />Along with the incredible dialog and storytelling, David Milch has introduced possibly the greatest character to ever come to TV or film...Al Swearengen. Ian McShane plays Al with the same intense conviction and truth that the character himself lives by. In Al's world things are black and white and never apologizes for a second for living his life by a strict code of morals of his own making. I don't think we've ever seen a character go from crying after a mercy killing to watching a murder he orchestrated stone faced. <br /><br />This is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth...Instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves.\",\n",

       " 'Deadwood is the finest Television program of all time in my opinion. This is high praise, considering West Wing, Hill Street Blues, and LAPD Blue. Everything about this series is top notch. The sets, the lighting, the lack of music to lead your emotions with only timely exceptions. The acting is outstanding across the board. But it is the writing that puts it in the stratosphere. David Milch combines the profane with an Elizabethan, Shakespearian, dialog that defies description. It is almost otherworldly in its beauty and deep meaning. Nowhere, in TV or movies, have I found writing and characters this good. It was truly a pleasure to see where each new episode was going.<br /><br />I was deeply saddened when this show was canceled, as it seemed there should have been one or two more years left to finish the story of Deadwood and these remarkable characters. We may never see this rich a collection of both characters and actors again.<br /><br />Well done everyone involved.',\n",
       " 'Like \"Six Feet Under\" and \"The Sopranos\" before it, Deadwood is emblematic of the fact that long form, done \"right,\" provides a far broader palette for art than dinky old \"cinema\" ever could. (Sorry, cinema, you were my first love, but... that was before I knew!) The depths of character, the unremitting beauty and profundity of the dialogue... This show is Shakespeare/Dickens on TV, week after week. People will CLEARly still be watching Deadwood in a hundred years -- probably still in a THOUSAND, if the species lasts that long. They will be teaching it in high school. This show never ceases to explore and challenge its vast interpersonal landscape. It shines constant and ever brightening light into the murky depths of the human soul. Watching it, the jaw drops and only continues to plummet as the seasons roll all too quickly by.',\n",

I am not foolish enough to think that it is all about me, but after reading the web Blog's and feeling other viewers comments I know that I am not alone.<br /><br />When and if HBO ever does anything about this I will be there to pick up where Deadwood left me...\",\n",

       " \"When we all thought that the western had lost its appeal in our modern day and age, HBO came with a title that definitely proves otherwise. With the stunning visual imagery of a Sergio Leone flick and the sex, intrigues and violence of ''The Sopranos'', they make the genre come to live as never before. <br /><br />''Deadwood'' tells the distinctive story of a little village that strives to stay a free haven for mobsters and corruption. Big corporations, hoodlums and authority figures all want a piece of it, but local mob leader Al Sweregan ( Ian McShane ) is stopping them with his cunning tactics and violent methods. And then there is local lawman Seth Bullock ( Timothy Olyphant ) being as idealistic as bendable towards the law. Others are the emotionally damaged Calamity Jane, the sweet natured Charlie Utter, the Jewish friend of Bullock Sol Star, grieving widow with a drug addiction Alma Garret, and the whores Trixie and Joannie Stubbs. This is just a small grasp of the colorful bunch of characters that this show has to offer.<br /><br />I adore this show for being painfully raw and oddly sensitive at the same time. People aren't exactly nice to each other, but that doesn't stop unusual friendships and relationships from occurring. People are neither good or bad. Their choices are all based on the need to get things done, even if it has a negative effect on the lives of others. And sometimes there is no other option than to be cruel. This show really portrays our ambiguous nature as human beings.<br /><br />Thanks HBO, for another great show that became one of my favorites!\",\n",
       " \"Absolutely superb. I don't think I've ever given anything a 10/10 before, but for a TV show, Deadwood is excellent - and given the crap we're generally subjected to on the box, absolutely outstanding. The sets, the research, the directing, the characters, the acting - all shine. And without wanting to sound gushy, the script is close to Shakespearian in its prosaic yet pragmatic tone. The juxtaposition of the grit and dirt and blood of the real 'Wild West' with formal Victorian language is genius. Even the opening credits are beautiful. It may not be everyone's cup of tea (the language and content can be a little 'strong' although entirely appropriate and in context) but anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment, shouldn't go past it.\",\n",
       " 'David Milch wrote DEADWOOD like nobody else writes anything: Dictated, open-source and interactive; just-in-time inventory created nearly on-the-spot so actors and crew could barely get it executed. Nearly everyone who can read has been subjected to lessons in civics and history in which glowing images of founding fathers and inspired visionaries brought forth upon this continent a new nation... <br /><br />I think DEADWOOD is an antidote for all manner of propaganda, because it was pointedly intended to illustrate the evolution of orderly society from anarchy. It might have been set 2000 years ago at the conclusion of Republican Rome, but HBO already had something similar scheduled. So Milch turned to a more contemporary point in time in which thousands of imaginations snapped toward The Black Hills, impassioned by an American Dream of personal wealth (The Golden Rule) and beat an amoral path to get (and keep) theirs\\' first, in yet another time of violent transition. Custer died the day the telephone was first publicly demonstrated. Odd. <br /><br />Ironically, the rule of gold and the search for color drew damaged, self-serving anarchists together in a bizarre perversion of selfishness that came to strongly resemble civic pride and benevolent altruism. At least, that\\'s what DEADWOOD presents to me in the form of a truly fascinating entertainment that also unmakes the familiar, laconic Hollywood Western hero, who was the self-censored product of 30s Hollywood moguls\\' anticipatory auto-antisemitism. <br /><br />About a year ago, David Milch presented many of his DEADWOOD intentions to an audience at M.I.T., in the form of a riveting interview. More clearly than in two seasons of DVD commentaries, he justifies his use of profanity in the series, explains his resistance to modern settings, and places the responsibility for understanding the DEADWOOD phenomenon on the audience, because the networks can\\'t be bothered to re-educate anybody. In This class, there will be no yawning. <br /><br />Please check it out. Just drop \"Milch MIT\" into a search engine, and you\\'ll be streaming the 83minute free interview in no time.',\n",

After watching 3-4 episodes Ian McShane immediately rocketed to my top 5 actors merely for his role on this show. Yes this show does have a few \"goofs\" as you call them in vocabulary, but who cares, why be nit picky.

Instead it is more of a treatment of an historical era lent to a respect for authenticity without compromising entertainment value.<br /><br />The scripting, casts, direction and sets are astounding. It is the first television miniseries (save for the Sopranos) that leaves me wanting for more and truly sad to see a season's ending.

       " \"For some reason television has been pretty damn good recently, with CSI, The Shield, Sopranos, etc raising the bar. Yet Deadwood goes beyond all of these. The acting is amazing, the sets are realistic...but most importantly the writing is brilliant. The dialogue is unlike any on television, and because of this the show seems more realistic and engaging than any Western movie or series ever before. Ian MacShane's Swearengen is beyond brilliance...for sheer violence he is more vicious than Tony Soprano or Vic Mackey, yet Swearengen has an intelligence and foresight they both lack. The show is violent, profane...and so is life. Come on HBO, bring Deadwood back...or at least hasten the taping of the new specials.\",\n",

Over the top perhaps but after a seeing a review on Charlie Brookers screenwipe I immediately bought the dvds and instantly became addicted. My only problem I have with this program is that it caused me and my friends to neglect our Uni exams. It is without doubt the most realistic portrayal of the West and sometimes this can be annoying, for instance when Wild Bill Hickock is shot dead I was furious at how easily it was done but that would be how it was. Sometimes I wish Calamity Jane was more tough as she always appears 'all talk' to me but this further adds to the complexity of each character no matter how minor. The most moving moments to me are a toss up between the confrontation between Dan Dority and doc Cochran over Sofia Metz or one single moment when Swearengen watches Reverand Smith mad ranting from the balcony with a tear in his eye. These moments for me show the versatility and complexity of Deadwood and its characters.<br /><br />Watch it! From the start!!\",\n",

       " \"Ah, Deadwood. Not so much a television series as an opera without music, Deadwood is painted on a very broad canvas. Is it Swearengen's soliloquies to the severed head in a box? What about E. B. and his eloquent rants at fate or the bone deep brutality of Tolliver? Perhaps it's the earthy, pragmatic Trixie or Calamity Jane, who manages to be both world-weary and innocent. Maybe it's David Milch's Shakespearean language. Whatever it is, Deadwood ranks as one of the best and most unusual series in television history.<br /><br />If you are a fan of great character actors or just excellent acting in general, this is the series for you because Deadwood is all about the people. That may sound obvious, but Deadwood's brilliance comes entirely from its characters and what they have to say. You could set them on the moon and they would still fascinate.<br /><br />Noting a few of my favorites, Ian McShane has always been fabulous but what fun to see him as the foul-mouthed Al Swearengen. He dominates the town by sheer force of personality. Of course, Al is also very intelligent and frequently finds himself surrounded by idiots - a couple of said idiots wonderfully played by William Sanderson and W. Earl Brown. Powers Boothe, who excels at charismatic villains (anyone remember him as Jim Jones?) has fun with Cy Tolliver. A couple of (to me) unknowns who turn in great work are Robin Weigert as Jane and Paula Malcomson as Trixie. And then there's the Doc; Brad Dourif in a long overdue role. Garret Dillahunt, so creepy as Wolcott, needs to be careful he doesn't get type-cast \\x96 unless he really is that bent???? And John Hawkes and Gerald McRaney and Titus Welliver and . . . and . . . !

Her (and my genteel grandmother\\'s, and my refined mother\\'s) frequently used expletives included the likes of \"Judas Priest\" \\x96 indicating that the most dire and terrifying consequences were impending. Other invectives and exclamations similarly invoked the deity, or were inspired by classical literature, the Bible, and popular song, and are now incomprehensible to us. These have simply been \"translated\" for us, where necessary, or conveyed to us \"as is\" when they still make scatological sense today.<br /><br />This could easily be one of, if not THE, greatest accomplishment in Modern American Theatre (it IS theatrical), and even in contemporary Literature. (I predict the scripts and performances will be studied in future college-level English Lit, Theatre/Drama, and Humanities classes.) But \"Deadwood\" will go out with a whimper, flawed and disappointingly ended due to HBO\\'s (and Milch\\'s) failure to see it through as projected and called-for by its very Art.<br /><br />Though \"Deadwood\" has become probably the greatest experiment (note the \"ex\" in that word!) in TV, it will unfortunately soon pass into the world of \"might have been\" without a satisfactory and worthy end. As most of you likely know, the sets have been struck, and the cast and crew will not be returning (at least as of this date) for a fourth season, as had been promised and anticipated in order to bring the cycle to an appropriate close. While as a portrayal of a moment in time, time and the world continue after the show ends, no matter when that is, the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe (and that\\'s a BIG maybe!) a 2-hour movie, or maybe 2 2-hour movies, sometime in the uncommitted future.<br /><br />If you care, please register your protest with HBO.

       " \"Deadwood was a lawless mining town founded around the 1870's and located near the Black Hills of South Dakota. It played host to such legends as Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok. It was a hell of a place to make your fortune. Deadwood, the HBO series, is the half-truth/half-fictional account of this town and more importantly, its rough inhabitants. Deadwood is a satisfying breath of fresh air into the neglected Western genre. Season 1 of this great series contains 12 one-hour shows and each one features compelling plots that build off each other, strong characters that look the part, and dirty locations and scenery that are spot on. Though this may be a TV show, nothing is held back! The language is obscenely vulgar (which seems to be historically accurate), violence is shocking and graphic, and the gritty atmosphere feels realistic and true to the times. That's not to say that the show doesn't have its lighter moments though\\x85in fact, it provides plenty of amusement. Anyway, the acting here must be acknowledged. From Timothy Olyphant as the no-nonsense Seth Bullock, to Robin Weigert as the fowl-mouthed Calamity Jane, to Ian McShane's Al Swearengen, the vicious saloon owner who more or less runs the town, they're all fantastic! Do yourself a favor, drink a few shots of whiskey and check out this enthralling, entertaining Western saga.\",\n",
       " 'Have to agree with \"Monumental\\'s\" rave out of Blighty, but the consensual 9.3, in view of much more \"substantial\" flicks and maybe even some teleseries, seems to me effusive. This David Milch oeuvre merits same, certainly, for setting and costume and the casting and acting are nonpareil throughout. But, at heart, this too is a \"fable\" of unrelenting stance and style and occasionally eyebrow-raising discomfitures of character and/or situation. The cussing becomes ho-hum, as intended?, but it\\'s the facile morphings of Swearingen and Bullock from scary villain to almost-lovable reprobate and stalwart no-nonsense hero to acquiescent second-banana. In this view, Brad Dourif\\'s \"Doc\" is the most consistent and audience-friendly of the lot, even if he\\'s almost too worldly and wise, it would seem, for both period and locale. At bottom, the series is a direct peel-off from the late, great \"Hill Street Blues\" template, from ensemble characterizations to the true-blue \"realisms\" of the respective subjects and themes. Still, none of this takes away from the incredibly maintained mise-en-scene that would do credit to any filmmaker, much less mere teleseries wonks. What?, the latter are making monkeys out of the former nowadays. Oh, minor quibbles: meseems poor Calamity Jane has been overworked for comic relief sometimes, and, I would be curious for the historic citations for the likes of Mr. Wu and his pigpen. Nice designated pinch hitter though, for exotic \"color\"? The game\\'s underfoot, Watson.<br /><br />Addendum: After turning cartwheels for the likes of Season 1, and even extending into Season 2, I, personally, revise my reactions halfway through the Season 3 episodes. There can be no question about the polished savvy of the creators here, indeed, their accomplishments seem all that more astonishing. But, to me, the fact of the matter is that by Season 3, \"Deadwood\" had become almost a parody of itself, which is to say, \"high camp.\" I can\\'t quite take seriously the evolutions herein, including the Earp brothers as Blackwater types, even as seasoned vets like Gerald McRaney and Brian Cox, and even Gale Harold, make you sit up and take notice despite your askance. ALL sustaining members of the ensemble cast continue to maintain their individual \"roles,\" even Robin Weigard\\'s? late-blooming lesbian, albeit the writers and directors have a hard time making it convincing. Someone has posted here the claim that this \"Deadwood\" is a dead ringer for the historic one, coming from a resident there it should matter, but, skeptic that I remain, I have to believe that it can only be \"half\" the \"tale,\" entertaining and theatrical as it is. And, finally, I personally find two \"racial\" elements that fail to ring my bell, to wit, the characterizations of the Negro mama and stable owner, and, more to the point, that of Wu. In that last case, the writers DID ring in the verity of \"heng-dai,\" but assembled 150 \"Chinese\" between Cheyenne and Deadwood? Oh, well, this IS a fable, no? And a damnably satisfying one at that. But, to me, its \"history\"city falls considerably short of that of its fellow stablemate telesries, \"Rome,\" which evinces ALL the strengths and glories and less of the stagings and asides.',\n",
       " \"David Milch has done such an amazing job with Deadwood in every way. The cast is a who's who of veteran character actors that, led by Ian McShane and Kieth Caradine, are truly superior in expression and delivery. The writing is top notch (Milch may be the best dialog writer going), and weaves the facts of the real history of Deadwood Gulch (one of the last American gold rush towns) with a few imagined characters amongst the many based on actual personages to craft and pace the storytelling properly. Milch has said that the underlying theme of Deadwood is the development of order in a culture where laws do not yet exist (Deadwood is in Indian territory, and hence outside of the U.S. proper). It is set in 1877, two weeks have passed since Custer's defeat, and the new town that sprung up on the back of the gold rush is chockablock with foul mouthed characters of all types, either looking to prospect, or service those who are finding the gold. This is by far the best western I've ever encountered. There is a lot of swearing, and the violence that occurs is fairly disturbing, but in my opinion, are necessary to the authenticity of the show. 10 out of 10\",\n",
       " \"It is understandable that DEADWOOD is not for every viewer, the treatment of women, children and men - regardless of size, shape and color - is often violent or at the least brutal, heartlessness abounds and a pretty picture it does not make. The only thing is, it is done so well you are impelled to watch some more, the characters so convincingly portrayed that even though a great deal of fictional license is taken in portraying historical figures, the feel and sense of the place and the people who lived there seem real. The entire production is of the highest quality no matter what aspect might be considered. And because we intuitively know that this phase of America's history is based on violence and brutality, lawlessness and heartlessness did abound and this does not fit well into the self-image that the so-called Heartland so cherishes. Despite some stiff competition, from Sopranos to Six Feet Under, there is probably no show on television which shows Americans and their sense of family and community better than Deadwood. Hopefully HBO will continue to produce such quality writing.\",\n",
       " \"Western have always been a popular stable of American culture, from pulp fiction stories, to films like The Searchers, the Man With No Name Trilogy, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven and The Assassination of Jesse James. HBO has also produced some of the best television ever made, The Sopranos, Oz, Rome. Deadwood is a fine addition to that list.<br /><br />Set in the years 1876 to 1878, Deadwood is set in the town of Deadwood, South Dakota. Deadwood starts off as a small camp and slowly becomes a town through the course of the show. Deadwood is a growing town with gold prospers and becomes a area of interest for businesses, politicians and criminals. The show focuses on a number of characters, the town sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), his deputy Sol Star (John Hawkes), salon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) and prospector/mine owner Alma Garret (Molly Parker), as well as many key supporting characters throughout the series. The series focuses conflicts within the town. In the first series the main focus the conflict between Swearengen and Bullock over Garret's gold claim, one wants to protect her, the other wants to take it off her. The second is about Deadwood's attempt to become a part of South Deadwood and with outside interests wanting to take over people's gold claims from under them. The final series is about the conflict between Deadwood's citizens with the evil George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) who wants to take control of the town, using his thugs to gain it.<br /><br />The show is bold, focusing on themes about growth of law and order, the Untied States and Democracy in a small time. Deadwood and people change with the wider world. They are looks at industrialization process with minor themes about trade unionism, the growth of politics and the benefits and disadvantages of joining the union. The show also takes an new look of the west, it was not a glamorous world, but also looks at the influence of big business and not just individuals. The show looks at crime within the town, looking at drug dealing, prostitution, gambling and gang wars. This makes for interesting and entertaining viewing. This is a refreshing look at the west, almost like the Sopranos of the nineteenth century. There are subplots, from youth crime, to homosexuality to a very good one about a psychopathic serial killer. Deadwood is the closer America has come to making a costumer drama.<br /><br />The series has excellent characters and actors playing them. Swearengen is easily the best and Ian McShane made the role and Powers Boothe as his rival. There are good guest stars like Brain Cox who plays an over the top characters and Gerald McRaney as the quiet villain. I really like Garret Dillahunt as the villainous psycho. There are good supporting characters such as Mr. Wu, the leader of the Chinese and has some great comical moments with Swearengen and Joanne Stubbs, a prostitute who questions herself.<br /><br />The show is good for the most part but it is not perfect. The first is that in the show there are so many subplots that they end up unresolved and sometimes hard to follow. It takes away a compelling viewing. The second is the main character Bullock and the actor who plays him. The character is stiff and wooden compared to most of the other characters in the series and he is too righteous for his own good. He isn't interesting. Timothy Olyphant is a very wooden, a very dull actor. The character Alma also suffer from a similar problem, but Molly Parker is a pretty decent actress.\",\n",
       " \"I just finished watching all 3 seasons and for the most part I thought it was good, season 1 was great, then season 2 introduced the George Hearst situation which after building up for 2 seasons I felt was a really crap finale: I mean Hearst hired 50+ Pinkertons whilst finally getting Mrs Ellsworth to sign over her claim, so Al Swearengen sent off for reinforcements, (Mr Wu's men and Hawkeye's men) but then Hearst just up and left!!!?? I mean all that build-up, all those Pinkertons, and they just left without a single gun-shot!!!??? I feel almost cheated!! Additionally, we never did hear the results of the elections!! And was anyone else curious why they turned Wyatt Earp and his brother Morgan into total morons!? And the way Wild Bill Hickok died; with his back turned, playing Poker? What the hell? Could have made that a bit more interesting!! And the relationship between Bullock and Mrs Ellsworth, that needs resolving!! And what happened about Mrs Ellsworth's offer to E.B Farnum to buy his hotel? She didn't seem at all bothered that he didn't sell to her but did sell to Mr Hearst!? And to be honest, was all the swearing really necessary? They need to make a 4 season to answer these problems!\",\n",
       " \"Deadwood is an amazing show. The only knock I could have against it is that you have to be really careful who you let watch it because it is not for family/children viewing at all. There is more swearing than I think in any other show I have ever seen, also there is nudity, sex, etc. Of course there is violence as well. The performances in this show are amazing whoever did the casting for this show hit the nail on the head with every single character they cast for. The actors are all totally believable in every role on this show. The writing is also very good it is simply a great show that mature audiences will probably really enjoy as long as they don't mind all the swearing etc. Not for everyone but great for those who can stomach the violence, swearing and so forth.\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, it is sad when a show you watch ends.....but it is very different when something like this ends. Deadwood is not a TV show. Deadwood was an experience, my roommate watched an episode with me one night and he was INSTANTLY hooked.<br /><br />And he loves it just as much as I do.<br /><br />Every aspect of the series was perfect. From the setting, cast, acting, writing, and just the entire idea of what this show is. I think most people who have had the opportunity to enjoy this show would say this is maybe the most beautifully written drama since Shakespeare. The words used were just beautiful to listen to and their meaning was........full. I don\\'t know how else to describe it. Every piece of dialogue meant something. There was no wasted chit chat, just to pass the time like other shows do (a lot). Character and plot were in constant development and ever-changing.<br /><br />Of course, the star of the show is Ian McShane. Maybe the best acting ever, easily for a Cable TV Show. OK, a brilliant lead actor, what else? Well, everyone else was superb also. I really cannot think of one bad performance. IMO the worst was Steve the Drunk, but I would still give his acting an \"A\".<br /><br />I love Timothy Olyphant and his character, Seth Bullock. It was not nearly as good as Ian McShane, but the character was not supposed to be that way. Olyphant did a good job because he was calm, yet you could feel the fury and rage burning inside him. It was given to the viewer, and every episode you waited for him to explode........that is drama.',\n",
       " \"Deadwood is a landmark in TV dramatisation - technically as well as logistically. It's also a superb multi-level drama and a stunningly accurate-seeming (who knows for sure?) recreation of a Gold Rush town, with layers of thought-provoking parallels to our modern political situation. The trouble with its overall excellence is that one or two faults stick out like chicken bones in a tobacco wad.<br /><br />Plot:(SPOILERS) Over the whole series there's a sense of anticlimax. Among the much-trumpeted gangs of hired guns and the convoluted human tragedies, the main baddie simply - leaves town; Swearengen decides to kill a scapegoat and that's it. We are already aware that he has a heart, so the decision not to kill Trixie is a given. While Deadwood is commendably faithful to the idea of realism in the plot most of the time, dramatically this becomes a letdown, and nor is it made clear enough why just killing Hearst wouldn't work. I anticipated a new take on a three-way gun battle, and when that didn't happen there wasn't much agonising about anything else. And there were far too many loose ends. Drama suffered here for realism's sake.<br /><br />Characters: There are some classic cameos in Deadwood: my favourites are Doc Cochran, Reverend Smith (why no website profile?) and Richardson, and Trixie is amazingly modern and three-dimensional. The character that doesn't work for me is Calamity Jane, in spite of Robin Weigert's faultless realisation of the script. I see where Milch is coming from - she's a lovable drunk, as opposed to, say, Steve the unlovable drunk - but you only have to see one photo of the actual woman to realise that they've been extremely kind in their casting. If you're going to make Calamity Jane's reason for being in it being a pioneering lesbian, she's got to be the bullest of bull dykes. Robin Weigert's just a misunderstood tomboy. Where was the realism here? I also feel that there are eventually too many characters introduced: if you left the Langrishe Theatre Group out completely it would make very little difference to the overall plot, and while Brian Cox is as good as I've ever seen him, that particular brand of scenery-chewing tends to rub off on the other actors - and it did. Powers Boothe turned from a believable rival to Al into a moustache-twirling pantomime villain, less convincing than E.B. Farnum. The two sassy soldiers at the Stirgis election were fantastically menacing; where was the menace (apart from Hearst per se) in Deadwood itself?<br /><br />Performances: The one performance that really lets Deadwood down (from an Olympian height) for me is Timothy Olyphant. He looks great, and ranges from caring husband to psycho killer beautifully. So why is it that I keep thinking he's about to burst out laughing at the wrong moment? Maybe he's just trying to hide his cute teeth, instead of baring and grinding them. He's like Roger Moore as James Bond: just too smooth. I wonder if that's why they kept giving Seth Bullock all those scars. The face-pummelling on the floor almost becomes a running gag.<br /><br />From the start, I really thought Deadwood was going to blow me away. In the end, while it sets the bar for Hi-Def TV to come, I felt it got bogged down in all that realism, and eventually stopped being a better-than-first-rate drama and became a first-rate docu-drama with a bit too much over-acting in places and far, far more cast than was well utilised. But it's a pioneering chunk of TV, best seen and heard in HD.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m watching the DVDs of DEADWOOD third season and it seems that somewhere near the middle or the end of season two, Milch\\'s writing became infected with writing disease. You can usually sleep this off, but perhaps the production schedule prohibited that. <br /><br />Many people in entertainment forums marvel at Milch\\'s writing, but it\\'s a question of balance. Forgive the cliché, but sometimes \"less is more\". The Shakespeare bug bit Dave, apparently, and, no, it\\'s not that he\\'s trying to write like Shakespeare wrote, but he\\'s trying, way too hard, to write GREAT--and he can\\'t. Here and there he can, yes, but not for every character in every other line. A little greatness goes a long way. <br /><br />Something gotta give when almost everyone is speaking in their very own stilted \"high-style\". The scenes bog down. The flow of the story falters, and even stops. Make way for The Writing! The story even becomes predictable, because every scene is merely a vehicle for Milch-speech. You\\'re walking along, trying to groove with the story, and you step in a sticky puddle of piddle. <br /><br />This is not how people apprehend a story, through the preciously special use of \"language\". People apprehend a story by identifying with its characters, perhaps in spite of the writing, and Milch\\'s writing--like Mamet\\'s, by the way--too often shackles the actors, and literally tries to steal the scene from them, always for the worst. The \"writing\", having a life of its own, eclipses the characters, that the actors have busted their guts over to bring to life. There ends up being just one character: Milch.<br /><br />Having said that, I notice the stories flow better when people other than Milch write. Plot comes first, it seems, when others write. As it should. Minus the goofy \"comic relief\" half-scenes, the stories are compelling, and I\\'m sorta sorry there won\\'t be another season--even if I believe Deadwood is pretty much tapped out.',\n",
       " 'After hearing nothing but praise I finally got to see the first season of Deadwood. <br /><br />What struck me again and again is the awfully affected performance by Molly Parker. While the rest of the cast speak in clear tones, Molly Parker speaks in studied whispers. Her transformation from addict does not change her self-conscious and unauthentic performance. She is simply unable to deliver a line or word without constant nervous affectation.<br /><br />She is also sexless, so the \"blossoming\" love affair has no spark. Why anyone would think that Parker is an actor of talent is beyond me. Her performance is at odds with the rest of the reliable cast.<br /><br />I find the use of the constant swearing distracting because it is anachronistic. The odd modern swear word would have impact but it is excessive and soon becomes tiresome.<br /><br />Basically, the show is not as good as it thinks it is.',\n",
       " \"OK this film has virtually no budget for a sci-fi movie and no real stars to speak of other than Peter 'Robocop' Weller but that doesn't matter because what it does have is a good story well told. It's a shame that bigger budget sci-fi productions never seem to remember that sci-fi should be have an interesting premise and not just throw a few explosions at the screen every few minutes.<br /><br />What is on offer in Screamers is a solidly entertaining 1hr 40mins of sci fi fun, reasonable acting and a great story based on a Phillip K Dick short. The main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that can't be stopped.<br /><br />For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10\",\n",
       " 'Screamers impressed the heck out of me. Reviews I\\'d read of it called it a \"slasher\" movie and said that it was highly derivative of other movies, such as Aliens and Blade Runner.<br /><br />In fact, I found it to be highly imaginative and original, very much in the spirit of the Philip K. Dick story that inspired it, pondering the ultimate meanings of humanity, war and technology. The scenery and story surrounding the film were both intriguing: despite the film\\'s low budget, the director did an excellent job of constructing the devastated planet. Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin turned in excellent performances, and the supporting cast was also quite good. Finally, every scene is shot with a real urgency to it; particularly well done are the nightmarish confrontation 2/3 of the way through the movie and the poignant and shattering ending. In short, this is a very very good movie and well worth renting. It will stay with you for quite a while.<br /><br />Before signing off, I should say something about construing one science fiction movie as a ripoff of others. Screamers had elements of its plot which can be found in other films (ie men and machines, monsters) but it blends them seamlessly into its own original story. The mere presence of identifiable elements from other films has given people ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal. By their standards, I don\\'t think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything. These surface similarities will always be there. One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates\\' cave allegory. In conclusion: ignore the critics and see Screamers!!',\n",
       " 'Screamers is a futuristic Sci-Fi Horror set on another planet, Sirius 6B. The film starts off very poorly with a narrative spoken in a robotic voice, indicating that Screamers will be no more than Z-grade garbage. Luckily, Screamers proves to be a respectable, suspense filled film that superbly displays the extremes of raw human emotions.<br /><br />Screamers always has the advantage that it was written by Philip K. Dick, the author whose stories lead to Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report. Whilst Screamers is no way in the same league as these films, it is much more thought provoking and gripping than other Sci-Fi films on a similar budget. The pace at which the plot moves is extremely intense; it seizes the attention of the audience and leaves them waiting for the next scene. The relationships between each character are all very compelling; every character has their own little story which ensures Screamers does not become one dimensional.<br /><br />Peter Weller is excellent in his role as Hendrickson. I\\'ve only seen him in Robocop so it is good to know he is not simply good at playing a robot. His character is complex as he misses earth, yet has submitted to being stuck on Sirius 6B. His relationship with Jessica (Jennifer Rubin) develops wonderfully throughout the film and is a good contrast to the horror taking place. Jennifer Rubin also puts on a great performance as her character starts as a mystery and gradually opens up in to someone the audience really cares for.<br /><br />The \"Screamers\" are a tremendous idea as underground defence robots who adapt to produce a new, human looking batch of screamers. The sound they make is very chilling and really brings up the hairs on the back of your neck; this is greatly reflected in the characters reactions on hearing the screams. Sadly, poor stop motion effects mean it is a disappointment when it comes to seeing the screamers attack but it is not hard to overlook special effects for a good story.<br /><br />It is a shame Screamers wasn\\'t given more budget as it had potential to be a truly great film. I don\\'t care about special effects very much but I feel the films vision could have been realised more if there was more money in this area. Also some of the sets are poorly designed as there appears to be a lack of effort in some places. The outlook is supposed to be bleak but the director does little to emphasise this.<br /><br />Possibly the best thing about Screamers is the end. With paranoia levels reaching those in The Thing, the twist at the end is very surprising and tense. Weller and Rubin really shine in these scenes and do well to affect the audience\\'s emotions. The script, which is good throughout, is also especially good in the final sequence.<br /><br />With more money behind it and better direction, Screamers would be a Sci-Fi classic, as it is, Screamers is an underrated, well acted, great story.',\n",
       " 'Based on a Phillip K. Dick story (the writer of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\" which was the background for \"Blade Runner\") this movie delivers, but suffers because of the apparently tight budget. Some scenes in here reminded me of the original \"Star Trek\" episodes, where the production crew had to become quite inventive to get effects on an almost non-existing budget.<br /><br />So movies low on money have to rely on their scripts and on good actors, and \"Screamers\" has them both. The story and its subplots could serve for three movies and especially Peter Weller showed a superb performance here. Generally there are some weaknesses, but they can be forgiven, if you allow yourself to get into the story.<br /><br />If you have enough of FX loaded movies that cover their thin plot with a multitude of explosions, then give it a try.',\n",
       " 'Under rated, scary, yes, even creepy. I LIKE IT! I rented the DVD years ago, and look to buy it for my collection... to put next to my soldier and starship troopers dvds, no less. Petter Weller carried the movie. No doubt about it. The whiny, phsycologically scarred soldier from the NEBs was far better tolerated than Mr \"Game over man!\" from Aliens (bill paxton at his unusual worst). This movie deserved a better budget, but was well made within what they had. Yes, I see the static back drops... a far cry from the dynamic CG animated ones we have grown used to in recent films. However, the \"Outer Limits\" style of cinematogrophy worked well for me. Okay, everyone just getting up and dusting themselves off after launching a mini-nuke into their kid-infested base was unrealistic and could have been portrayed better. The David screamer caught me off guard from the beginning, I didn\\'t suspect anything until he was shot. And the chick? classic move. The teady bear at the end was UBER CREEPY... and begs for a WELL DONE sequel... with Peter Weller... or else don\\'t even try. Mark this as one of my favorite unsung movies. A must see for the SCI-FI afficianado.',\n",

If you liked either of those movies,you will enjoy this movie for its intelligent entertainment.<br /><br />Weller's character Hendricksson is fairly straight forward as a disenchanted commander believing that his command has been abandoned and that their battles on this outpost planet have been made irrelevant by the higher authorities. Consequently, Hendricksson sets out to bring a truce proposal to the enemy forces.<br /><br />But technology gone awry rears its ugly head in the form of self-manufacturing killing devices known as the screamers named for their high pitched sound just before they slice and dice humans.\",\n",

I thought this movie was probably one of the best sci-fi films in years that I've seen. Peter Weller (best known as RoboCop) is also a very under-rated actor who deserves some good roles these days. The only problem with this movie was the very poorly done special fx. I'm sure if this movie would have been given a bigger budget it would have done better in theaters.\",\n",
       " \"For the few who happen to be fans of Peter Weller, this is certainly one to hang onto. A great little film that is just as brutal and vicious as any movie by Paul Verhoeven. I was surprised Verhoeven didn't direct a film like this. A little cheesy, but often times interesting, Screamers is a little film I like quite a bit. The funny thing is, I liked this film, even though I had watched Twelve Monkeys just a couple hours earlier (I did a little theater hopping). A cool little film with a freaky ending.\",\n",
       " \"A well made, gritty science fiction movie, it could be lost among hundreds of other similar movies, but it has several strong points to keep it near the top. For one, the writing and directing is very solid, and it manages for the most part to avoid many sci-fi cliches, though not all of them. It does a good job of keeping you in suspense, and the landscape and look of the movie will appeal to sci-fi fans.<br /><br />If you're looking for a masterpiece, this isn't it. But if you're looking for good old fashioned post-apoc, gritty future in space sci-fi, with good suspense and special effects, then this is the movie for you. Thoroughly enjoyable, and a good ending.<br /><br />\",\n",
       " 'This was a pretty faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick\\'s story, \"The Second Variety\". The only major difference is that instead of a Cold War setting on Earth, they used a corporate setting on a colony world.<br /><br />So why did this movie rock? Because they stuck to the story, which was quite a good one, of killer robots who decide to ignore their programming to attack the enemy and consider all humans the enemy, and have developed a way to replicate them in the process.<br /><br />Peter Weller, whom I don\\'t consider a great actor, is at his best here, as a war weary commander who stumbles onto this shocking fact, as he tries to get back to his base to warn his comrades. Jennifer Rubin is pretty good as a killer android who doesn\\'t know what she is until the climax.<br /><br />They gave it a happier ending than Dick did, but still, a solid film.',\n",
       " \"Contemporary releases in sci-fi/horror genre prove that rich Hollywood filmmakers are running out of ideas. This film is really an excellent example of how you can do a great job with almost no money.<br /><br />The greatest thing in Screamers is that there is a message in it. It's just a way the real art should be - it should make people think, dream, use their imagination and not only consume the finished and totally digested pieces of information. And I think not many expensive Hollywood productions (especially sci-fi) are successful in this regard.<br /><br />So, for instance, the idea that someone who looks human, can be a rusted dead machine inside and you can never say who's who judging from their appearance. Or the forsaken soldiers who sacrifice their lives in a pointless war, which was forgotten by the governments who started it. Blood is cheaper than raw materials - this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today.<br /><br />In my opinion you mustn't have one million explosions or world-famous stars in a movie to make it good. It's just a good story, an appropriate atmosphere and some really well done acting to make it good. And in my opinion Screamers has all these elements.\",\n",

Screamers was a last choice rental. I'm glad I rented this movie, it was a lot better than the box office movies I rented. True this movie has a very low budget but thats what makes it great. It has the great sorta feel of (John Carpenter's The Thing). Its a desolete kind of movie. The acting in this movie is good, especially by Peter Weller. This movie is about the morality of machines made by man to fight other men, and then all of man fighting evolving machines that want to be like man, that use mans weaknesses against man. The premise is very intelligent, and the amount of action is perfect for the story to unfold. This movie will make you think! Well, It made me think. This movie is quite entertaining and is one of my all time favorites. It could of been improved a little bit but only by the supporting casts acting.

A Screamer was a man-made robot (sent to help one side) complete with an advanced A.I. who lurks beneath the ground waiting for its prey. Waiting silently and patiently. But little do both sides know that this man-made robot has got a few tricks up its own sleeve.

       " 'Really, I mean that this is a self-contained movie; it sets up a premise, a backdrop, characters... and manages to deliver. The grainy/gritty look of this film is really commendable, and instead of just saying \"Killer robots!\" and putting it on autopilot the filmmakers kept throwing little bits and pieces of creativity out there. Peter Weller is perfect for his role and develops great repartee with the greenie who tags along with him to... some pretty nice matte paintings. Budgetary constraints aside the movie looks good, the spaceships look good, the robots look good, and this is simply the kind of unified enterprise that doesn\\'t get made with $100,000,000 and Bruckheimer producing (what is it with the Germans? I mean, Devlin and Emmerich and Bruckheimer?). So watch it, it\\'s enjoyable and competent until the last 15 minutes.',\n",
       " 'I believe the original story that this film is based on is called \"Second Variety\", a great post-apocalyptic novel by Sci-fi meister Philip K. Dick. The film captures some of the terror from the original story, but director Christian Duguay and storywriter Dan OBannon fails to deliver the film that this had the potential to become. Philip K. Dick\\'s stories adapted to film have previously been great successes, like \"Blade Runner\" and \"Total Recall\". So why Duguay and OBannon chose to rewrite the ending completely into one of the worst cases of \"Hollywood Happy Ending\" I\\'ve ever seen, and in doing so completely removing the the ENTIRE plot of the original story, leaves me a bit provoked.<br /><br />My vote: 4 out of 10',\n",

The people in the base have to smoke some red cigarettes to protect their lungs from something in the air \"We have to protect our lungs from sh*t by putting sh*t in them\".

Although one of the lesser sci-fis(in my opinion) the storyline would have to be one of the best and the characters fit in perfectly. Peter Weller does a splendid job as Hendricksson. His acting performance is probably up there with his robocop one and it probably lifted his career to new heights. Special effects impress for 1995, as this helps lift 'Screamers' to new heights.

The script is ace because its written by Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Total Recall), and the director knows exactly what he's doing. It stars Peter Weller (from RoboCop), and he really shines as an actor in this film. Andy Lauer, who plays the rookie who is ironically nicknamed Ace, is also very good, as are Roy Dupois who plays the mysterious Becker, and Jennifer Rubin who plays Jessica.<br /><br />The story is interesting and has a sense of paranoia, because you never know who is a Screamer (a killer robot), and who isn't. The futuristic sets of a war-ravaged planet are also excellent, and the costumes and props to go with it are good too.<br /><br />The only thing that lets it down are the special effects. For some parts they are ok, like the spaceship taking off at the end. But the rest are not so good, such as the stop-motion Screamers that are outdated and when Becker gets shot in half.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very good movie. If it had a slightly higher budget to sort out those special effects it would get full marks, but as it is I give it 8/10.\",\n",

Also, despite the low budget, the effects were sufficiently good to suspend disbelief. In fact, the attention to detail (surroundings, back-ground, odd gadgets etc.) was excellent, as is important in all sci-fi films...by creating a coherent world, the movie becomes that much more convincing. The performances were excellent, for such a low budget, and some of the lines were very quotable (up there with the script of 'Aliens' if you ask me). This is always an advantage. However, right at the end, I felt a little let down by the love-scene. It kind of destroyed Philip k. Dick's 'message'.

When Joe-Joe dies, and his eyes are about to be closed, you can see that his eyes are closed to begin with. Matt Macoy then shows off his ability to shoot guns while blinking like a mad man. Matt Macoy dosen't even look like someone who'd be in the military, he looks like that substitute teacher who would always try to control you class and yell ' Guys....Guys...Guys comon'.....Guys....comon'guys...' and all you can do is laugh at him as you jump on you desk and shoot spitballs at him. Then you can see a guy who looks like Mister T on a different vehicle in a scene, then in the next scene he's on a different vehicle and then back on the first vehicle. I also never realized that you can shoot a bazooka at someone 10 feet away and nothing will happen to you, and that some people can throw a grenade and it will blow up instantly with a 30 foot high explosion. Also, its great to have a 9mm pistol that can hold up to 40 rounds and can take out 4 car tires in one shot. And the random goons who storm the office building shooting at papers on desks is pretty cool, if you like random goons who shoot at paper on desks that is. Also if your going to take on the U.S. army, there's no better way to do it with 65 guys that look like they shop at the G.A.P., gather them all up, buy a couple dingies, illegally enter America on these dingies, grab a couple of U-Haul vans and go to some building with a whole bunch of barricades around it and start shooting at desks. The icing on this crap-fest is the highly intense bus chase, because there is nothing more exiting than two buses driving in circles.

Some team of special forces if it takes them all day to inflate a couple of dingys . And wouldn`t the delta force or navy SEALS be doing this sort of stuff ? I`m just kind of curious why this film is called RANGERS ?<br /><br />So they carry on with their mission which confused me because if they`re posing as Syrians then that can only mean the action is taking place in Syria or the Lebanon ,neither country being at war so why`s this taking place in the middle of a war zone ? It gets worse though because one of the team says :<br /><br />\" This jobs easier than that twenty buck hoe I had in Las Vegas \"<br /><br />Yup there`s nothing more endearing to an audience than knowing one of the heroes has to pay for sex . In fact would a prostitute in Vegas be charging as little as twenty bucks ? Shows you how bad a film like RANGERS is when you find yourself asking questions like that .<br /><br />Enough . I could spend several pages writing about this piece of garbage but it`s not worth it . It`s a cheap straight to video film composed of stock footage and a bunch of non actors giving the impression they`re making the story up as they go along .

Where do I even start with this one? Well for one the whole commentary in which Wynorski keeps referring to the footage stolen as Delta Force 2, but it's actually Delta Force 1! Other such action sequences are from Red Heat,Invasion USA and Navy Seals. Rangers is utterly absurd with acting so wooden, action sequences so obviously lifted and plot angles so over the top ridiculous that you cannot believe they are serious. For instance the guy (footage necessary from Invasion USA) blows up his friend's house, not even knowing that his friend wasn't in on it? Or how the government don't do anything to stop this guy after he blew up the pentagon, jeez how dense are these guys?

After a few remaining members barely make it out, they find out that they\\'d been set-up, or something like that.

Ok, so there are occasionally some decent production values (a few respectable explosions), but as with all of these low-budget action films, the script seems to have been made up along the way. Obviously, these films don\\'t cost a great deal and can end up being bought for cable or home video release (as Fox has done with this film and the equally terrible monster picture \"Python\"). The storyline almost doesn\\'t even matter in a film like this one (nor do a few continuity errors) - the movie simply attempts several old-school, low-budget action sequences (according to the commentary, apparently some bits of the final action sequences are new, but many are actually cut in from a different, old action movie altogether).

The gizmo he has looks like it was made from spare parts in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.<br /><br />The film is blessed with two villains, industrialist Matthew Boulton and rival scientist Porter Hall both of whom want to get their hands on that formula and profit off it in some way. One way that wasn't even considered was that very few diamonds are used as jewelry. The majority are industrial strength and used for things like oil drill bits. A way to manufacture those babies on the cheap would yield someone a lot of money.<br /><br />John Barrymore plays the Scotland Yard inspector and by dint of his name is top billed over John Howard as Drummond. It's a sad come down for Barrymore who reminds me of J.D. Cannon as Chief Clifford in the McCloud series, the way Drummond constantly shows up the Yard. He also has a little bit of Perry White thrown in as he constantly is telling people 'don't call me inspector'.<br /><br />The science is a bit bizarre and the plot has way too many holes in it.

       " \"Preview: Summary: This one has a trained penguin<br /><br />This is the twelfth Bulldog Drummond film, the third starring John Howard as Drummond, and the second based on Sapper's novel 'The Third Round' (the first version of which was the silent film of 1925 'Bulldog Drummond's Third Round' starring Jack Buchanan, of which one print is said to survive in an archive). This one is tauter and more dramatic than most because it was edited by Ed Dymtryk. John Hogan also did a fine job of directing, with many dramatic angles and more closeups than were seen in the previous Drummond film by another director. There is interesting second unit material of London. The budget for this film was fairly ambitious, more so than in later efforts. Louise Campbell and Nydia Westman, the two irritating women, are kept under control and their roles minimized, to my great relief, and to the improvement of the drama. The lead billing once again is given to John Barrymore, who plays the Commissioner, but in this film, he acts up a storm and has many strong scenes, unlike the previous offering, 'Bulldog Drummond's Revenge', in which he sleep-walked through the story. So in this one, he really earned his fee for a change. The wonderful character actress Zeffie Tilbury here plays an amusing housekeeper who puts policemen in their place with the best East End cockney applomb, and takes no nonsense. Hogan, having just directed her in 'Scandal Street' (1938), evidently was responsible for introducing Elizabeth Patterson to the series, as a hysterical Aunt Blanche. Porter Hall puts in another of his villainous appearances, to excellent effect. (Villains are always so much more menacing when they speak quietly, as he does.) There are some amazing laboratory scenes in this film, reminiscent of Tesla, with surging electric currents and so forth, and one half expects a Frankenstein monster to appear. The story is about the manufacture of artificial diamonds, of the need to protect the diamond industry and, as Barrymore admits, to protect the Empire, from the threat of being able to make diamonds 'become as cheap as pebbles' and 'to be larger than the crown jewels'. Naturally, there is scope for villains galore with such a scenario. There is lots of action, plenty of train, car and motorbike chases, climbing up walls, and in this one, E. E. Clive as Tenny the gentleman's gentleman has the most energetic and active of all his Drummond roles, and hijacks a truck at gunpoint, hanging upside down from the roof. But most ingenious of all is the cute trained penguin who has more scenes than Louise Campbell and is a finer bird. Watch him hop and squawk, dear little thing. He also discovers a corpse under the table, which was a fine feathered deed worthy of this fast-moving film, which does not disappoint any stout Drummondonian.\",\n",

Movie mavens will recognize Franklin Pangborn as the dyspeptic husband, Una Merkel as his featherbrained wife, and Luis Alberni as the remarkable chef, all uncredited.<br /><br />Off-the-wall narrator Pete Smith would produce a reworked version of this story - with Oscar winning results - four years later in PENNY WISDOM (1937).<br /><br />Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios' feature films.\",\n",

An early technicolor about a man with indigestion, thanks to a wife who\\'s a klutzenheimer in the kitchen. Una Merkel plays the dippy wife -- she utters about 3 words but is told by the unseen narrator that he\\'s the only one allowed to talk! The narrator acts as an omnipotent overseer, putting broken eggs and spilled condiments back together again by the magic of reverse-action filming. He also brings in a chef in a puff of smoke, to come to the housewife\\'s rescue. We are then treated to a mini-cooking show, with instructions on how to prepare stuffed duck and baked apples. It\\'s quite droll, with the narrator getting off such funny zingers as: <br /><br />\"Cook the stuffing for 15 minutes, for that perfect taste that you love to burp up later.\" <br /><br />\"Now clutch the apple firmly so it will realize the futility of any resistance.\" <br /><br />Very funny and amusing. Too bad there\\'s no way to actually know when this will be on again. I don\\'t think TCM lists its one-reel wonders in its programming guide, which is too bad. Well, if you run across \"The Menu\" at the end of your regularly scheduled program, be sure to stick around and watch it. I think you\\'ll enjoy it!',\n",

The running time states that it is 10 minutes in length, but it seems much shorter than that. <br /><br />The short centers on a housewife and her feeble attempts at cooking. Her kitchen is in a shambles; everything she touches produces a sound effect and a wise crack from an omnipotent narrator (Pete Smith). Away from home, the husband sits in his office worrying about what his wife will be concocting in the kitchen for his consumption when he gets home. Meanwhile, at the office, his belly is aching, so he is never far from his bicarbonate of soda, which he keeps in his jacket pocket.<br /><br />The narrator keeps everything moving along very nicely as he throws in one liners, puns and wry observations of the hapless couple. The narrator also punctuates the proceedings by not only dropping in many appropriate sound effects, but also by bringing to life a chef to manage the wife's dinner arrangements. In a puff of smoke the chef enters into the kitchen and proceeds to teach the wife how to stuff a duck and bake some apples.<br /><br />When the husband comes home, the chef has disappeared and so has the husband's bicarbonate. The husband has a meal fit for a king, but he'll only be king for a day, I don't think this wife could make a bowl of cereal.<br /><br />After watching this short, I thought it was made sometime during the 1940's, but was completely shocked to see (while on IMDb) a release date of 1933.

       " 'First off; I can understand why people would dislike this movie; The characters are all portrayed in an extremely stereotypical way, the acting is considerably over the top most of the time, the story is rather cheesy and not very believable - I mean which gay couple would (or COULD) transform their eccentric home into a monastery-like environment in 24 hours to pretend to be a cultured family to impress the son\\'s fiancée\\'s parents?<br /><br />...Yet I couldn\\'t stop laughing all the way through, even after the 10th time. Why? It\\'s BECAUSE the characters are so stereotypical, it\\'s BECAUSE the acting is over the top, it\\'s BECAUSE the whole thing is so unbelievable that it makes it scintillating to behold. Even though the characters are stereotypical, the script has obviously been written by someone who doesn\\'t intend to contribute to the stereotypical view of the gay drag community, but who rather wanted to create characters that are lovable while at the same time shouting \"don\\'t take us seriously\". <br /><br />This isn\\'t a movie portraying life in the gay society; and everyone who expects realistic (and hence probably rather unfunny) portrayal of such a theme is better off NOT watching a comedy featuring gays (don\\'t most comedies thrive on making the stereotype seem funny?) It may not be politically correct all the way, but hey; society\\'s too hung up on all this political correctness as it is,. The characters in this movie were lovable, perhaps BECAUSE they were stereotypical depictions. However they\\'re brought to life so well by the actors playing them that it doesn\\'t make you shake your head in frustration over yet ANOTHER movie portraying stereotypes, but rather makes you shake your head in laughter over the deadpan things they say and do, which are so obviously unreal at times that anyone who thinks this movie will promote a false picture of the gay community needs a reality check. <br /><br />The script is amazing, and even though it may really be too over the top once in a while, it doesn\\'t distract from the overall picture. The story isn\\'t much; the focus on details is what makes this movie funny. Little gestures, frowns, face expressions and little subtleties make this movie one of the best comedies I have ever watched, and probably one of the best comedies I will ever be fortunate enough to see in my entire life. Contrary to what it may seem like at first sight, the humor is overly refined without being intellectual, instead of jumping in your face all the time.<br /><br />What\\'s more, the cast is great. Both Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are very fine comedians who have the touch it takes to play a role like this one. They make over-the-top stereotypes actually FUNNY, instead of just laughable.<br /><br />And yes, I HAVE seen the original movie, not all too long ago actually, and I have to say the remake is twenty to the power of 99 times better than the original. I barely laughed, and the original version was in my eyes an utterly forgettable movie. And that coming from a person who usually hates remakes. <br /><br />This movie gives the original \"Birdcage\" a fresh new shine and transports the story into the 90\\'s. Well made, on all accounts, I can\\'t think of a single criticism!',\n",
       " '\"The Birdcage\" is a hilarious movie about a happily \"married\" gay couple, forced to play straight for the marriage for Armond\\'s son and his conservative in-laws. Even though it is a bit stereotypical, it was played with charm and energy and is absolutely irresistible. I really enjoyed \"The Birdcage\" because it had a lot of serious issues, yet managed to turn into a fun joke. We take the politic stand on gay marriages so seriously, that I think this was needed just for a good laugh at it.<br /><br />Nathan Lane and Robin Williams, what terrific performances! Again, I know it was stereotypical, but I have a couple friends that do actually act like that. So, I was more than willing to go with it. I loved the whole Nathan being the Mom dinner scene. It was just too hard not to laugh. I am little surprised by the rating of 6.5. I think people should see this film and just have a good time with it. Trust me, it\\'s just a fun movie and it\\'s not offensive in any way.<br /><br />10/10',\n",
       " 'Way over the top, but utterly and completely hilarious just the same American remake of the popular 1978 French film/play \"La Cage Aux Folles\" about a gay nightclub owner and his flamboyant drag-queen lover (played by Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, two actors who I might say look like they were born to each be the comedic halves that equal one fall-down hilarious whole) who in an attempt to please and hopefully fool the conservative parents (played by Gene Hackman and Diane Wiest) of Williams\\' biological son\\'s (from what is obviously a previous liaison with a woman) fiancé, pretend for one evening to be a straight married couple, a la Williams is the husband and Lane is dressed up as the wife, with as it is blatantly apparent disastrous results! Absolutely nothing in this film is subtle I\\'ll admit, and almost all of the characters here are written to be little more than hokey caricature\\'s of nearly every gay stereotype going! However though, regardless of all that \"The Birdcage\" still winds up hitting the nail square on the head in terms of delivering to it\\'s audience some astounding energy, superb camp-value and knee-slappingly hilarious jokes/one-liners that are all topped by a nearly uncanny chemistry between the actors. Overall, if you can manage to get past some of the so-called \"Hollywood Clichés\" and cheap shots made at the kinds of people/life-styles featured here that are deemed offensive by some, and just watch this great flick for the uproarious and seemingly light-hearted romp that it was initially intended to be. Then ultimately you will be justly rewarded by film\\'s end because this is one of the few, and I do mean few, American remakes (and a comedy no less) that is worth watching time after time! (***** out of *****)',\n",
       " 'Though nothing can beat \"La Cage aux Folles,\" the film on which this American version is based, I still found \"The Birdcage\" delightful fun and hilarious at times, thanks to the comic geniuses of Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. Lane is the dramatic Albert, an over the top drag queen who has lived for years with Robin Williams, Armand, the owner of The Birdcage, where Albert performs. Armand once had a liaison with a woman, which produced a son, Val, who now wants to be married to the daughter of a conservative politician. In order for that to occur, Armand has to become butch, all gay art work, etc., needs to exit the apartment - and Albert must disappear for a few days.<br /><br />Williams is hilarious - my two favorite scenes are his rehearsal with Albert and a young man appearing with him on stage, and the scene where he coaches Armand on being macho - priceless. Nathan Lane\\'s shtick is familiar to me, as I\\'ve seen him in \"The Producers\" and \"The Odd Couple\" - he\\'s a riot as the insecure, jealous, easily hurt Albert.<br /><br />The role of Val is problematic, because how does one keep him from looking like a complete bastard as he shuts out Armand, who raised him. But Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart as Barbara make a lovely young couple. Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest are very funny as Barbara\\'s befuddled parents.<br /><br />It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve seen the French \"La Cage aux Folles,\" and I saw the musical on Broadway as well. The French is superior to any version. The musical is quite poignant and emphasizes its statement in the song, \"I Am Who I Am.\" The joy of the French film is that the actors playing the lovers, Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault, play their roles very seriously, and the humor and poignancy come out of the situation and the outrageousness of the Armand character (Albin/Zaza in the French). In \"The Birdcage,\" it\\'s played for comedy all the way. That\\'s okay. You\\'ll still enjoy it. But see the original.',\n",
       " \"THE BIRDCAGE is the hysterically entertaining Americanized version of the French classic LA CAGE AUX FOLLES. In this version Robin Williams plays the gay owner of a Florida nightclub who learns his straight son (Dan Futterman) is coming home and is engaged to be married. Williams learns from his son that his fiancée's parents (Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest) are straight-laced and ultra-conservative and will not be comfortable meeting his gay father or his even more flamboyant lover (Nathan Lane) and suggests Williams send Lane out of town while Hackman and Wiest are in town. Instead, Lane puts on his best drag and meets the parents as Williams' wife in one of the most hilarious dinner party scenes ever filmed. This film is chock full of sparkling dialogue and sharp performances. I also found it rather refreshing to see Robin Williams playing straight man to Lane, who along with Hank Azaria as their housekeeper, practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90's. And the sight of Gene Hackman in drag is something everyone must experience.\",\n",
       " \"This movie is one of the best. Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are phenomenal and hilarious, but the best performance throughout the film is by Hank Azaria, as Agador, the adorable flaming butler. My favorite scene is when both families are sitting together eating dinner. I don't want to give anything away, but wow I was in tears. Gene Hackman is extremely funny as a conservative senator. This film is colorful, unique and will keep an audience roaring with laughter. Yes, the movie follows some typical stereo types among a gay male couple, however, is not offensive in anyway, shape or form. I think this is such a cute film, and if you haven't seen it, or if you happen to be in the mood for a laugh out loud movie rent The Birdcage.<br /><br />My Rating: 9/10\",\n",
       " 'OH.. my GOd! What a wonderful story, what a comedy.. I have no words to describe what I felt when I watched this. You see Robin Williams in this whole new character , he has never played this kind of role before.. well it suits him, don\\'t you think? HE did a pretty good job with Armand Goldman, but what about his partner.. Nathan Lane, well what about him? He played perfectly his SHE.. Albert slash Starina Goldman slash Coleman role. They both do \"fosse,fosse,fosse.. Martha Graham.. Martha Graham.. MADONNA ..MADONNA! Who else could be a \"mother\", a \"Wife\" and \"just a guy\" if not Nathan Lane, his shrieking is so funny, he is a true woman in this picture. I can say nothing more about the \"Birdcage\", you better watch it and find out the rest yourself..',\n",
       " 'I saw \"The Birdcage\" because I\\'d already seen \"La Cage aux Folles.\" And I thought this one was a great remake, if not better. Robin Williams and Nathan Lane give hilarious performances as the lead couple. I haven\\'t seen \"La Cage\" in ages, but there were tidbits in \"The Birdcage\" that I remembered from the original. Of all American remakes of French movies, this is by far my favorite!',\n",
       " 'It\\'s hard to imagine saying this about an outrageous comedy, but Robin Williams - who made his career (at least the early part of it) by doing outrageous comedy (and the more outrageous the better) is completely, totally and absolutely outshone in \"The Bird Cage\" by Nathan Lane. That\\'s not a criticism of Williams. He was fine, but Lane was simply over the top funny as the very feminine drag queen Albert, the gay lover/spouse of Armand (Williams). Armand and Albert have a son they\\'ve raised (Val, played by Dan Futterman) and he\\'s about to get married to Barbara (Calista Flockhart). The catch? Barbara\\'s father is the extremely conservative Senator Kevin Keeler (Gene Hackman) and he\\'ll be none too pleased by the family his daughter is marrying in to.<br /><br />You\\'ll laugh pretty much the whole way through at Lane, and it isn\\'t just Lane. At times, Williams is playing the second or even third banana by the end of the movie. There\\'s Albert and Armand\\'s \"maid\" Agador Spartacus (Hank Azaria) who\\'s almost as funny as Lane, and (while I don\\'t want to give too much away) when you catch a glimpse of Hackman in drag near the end of the movie you\\'ll be in stitches.<br /><br />It\\'s great fun, burdened a little bit by an unnecessary decision to have Keeler involved in a political scandal. The whole movie would have worked quite well without that particular subplot. Still, this is a very funny movie. turn to it whenever you need a laugh. 8/10',\n",
       " 'I cannot believe how hilarious this movie turned out. It is one of the funniest movies I\\'ve ever seen. I can barely contain myself from bursting into laughter at just the thought of it. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, in fact the entire production is tres magnifique! I never had so much fun watching a movie. Each and every character is endearing and you get the feeling that each actor was born for exactly that role. I\\'m surprised there were no academy award nominations for Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman, Robin Williams and especially Hank Azaria, that entertainer-extraordinary wannabe, the \"Goldman\\'s faithful houseman\", LOL...I am laughing as I write this review, you must see it to appreciate it.....10 of 10 EXCELLENT!',\n",
       " \"One of the joys of watching good performers is seeing them fall so deeply into their role that when their character is asked to change, the change is so uncomfortable it either creates drama or comedy. In this case, we have comedic gold. Robin Williams headlines but Nathan Lane is the star of this filled festival of frolicing, where everybody throws in their characters worth and has the audience on the floor laughing.<br /><br />Robin Williams and Nathan Lane play two gay Jewish lovers in Florida who own a drag club called The Birdcage. William's straight son is going to get married to the daughter of a Rightest Senator from Ohio. Williams and Lane decide to try to play it straight for a night, which means turning everything in their comfortable world upside down and inside out to pull it all together.<br /><br />The writing is simply excellent, great dialog and very quotable. Even if the movie itself ended up terribly, it would have had good camp value regardless. However, the movie itself is supported strongly by the fantastic work of the acting, especially Lane because he is able to not only convince the audience about his character, but have his character try and act as well, thus creating multiple levels of personality hard to come to terms with inside of just one person. Williams does well too, but probably the best counterpart to Lane is Hank Azaria in a hilariously gay role and Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest as the conservative parents. They actually make the conservatism the movie pokes at believable while not becoming too mocking or too caricaturistic.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good time, and great fun for the whole (openminded) family.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB\",\n",
       " 'This is a funny, funny story about a gay couple pretending to be a straight couple to impress the family of the son\\'s fiancée. There are moral lessons in this comedy to live and let live and to judge people on their character, not their sexual orientation.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I watched this movie together and we both howled with laughter. We still treasure this movie and watch it again and again.<br /><br />We had not seen either the original play or movie so this was a standalone viewing. It was just terrific.<br /><br />Williams and Lane are perfect as the gay couple. The look on Williams\\' face when Lane comes into the house when the visitors are there is priceless. Williams is a great straight guy (pun intended) for Lane\\'s antics.<br /><br />I judge this movie on the amount of laughs it gave me and that has to be a \"10.\" Gene Hackman is perfect, as usual, as a moralizing, hypocritical Senator.',\n",

I laughed harder than when I saw \"Young Frankenstein\" for the first time years ago. I never thought I\\'d see another movie that would literally have me laughing so hard that tears were running down my cheek. The fact that Robin Williams and Gene Hackman were cast seemed a bit strange to me when I first saw the names of the cast, but they were perfect for the characters they portrayed. One of the most classic examples of the wit and genius performed in this film was when Diane Wiest looks at Gene Hackman when he\\'s saying what a fine \"lady\" Nathan Lane is, and he\\'s playing a Republican Senator! I would have given the writer and all the actors an Academy for this picture. Hopefully, people will see it for what it is...pure comedic genius at work! Just relax and have fun with it. Don\\'t try to read anything into it that you may think was NOT intentional because it was ALL intentional with extremely dramatic performances, and you know that the cast had a great time making it.You can even see Robin Williams starting to crack up when his \"male maid\" (Agador) is trying to toss the shrimp into his stew concoction! I\\'m still waiting for another classic like this one. During these trying days we all need a good laugh. WE ARE FAMILY!!!!',\n",
       " 'This movie is hilarious. Every single time I watch I laugh. I think that the acting is terrific and wonderfully over the top. That is the point of the movie, for the characters to be way over the top. My personal favorite is Agador played brilliantly by Hank Azaria. Every single time I see Agador I just my head off. Albert comes in an extremely close second, he is very funny and he makes a terrific women in drag. Nathan Lane is a genius! The chemistry between all the characters is wonderful. And for the record I have a lot of gay friends and a gay relative and none of them find this movie offensive in the least. They all think it is funny too.',\n",
       " 'In thinking through this movie, I struggled to recall one honest character. I believe it is Barbara\\'s mother. She is straightforward to the point of naiveté. The other assorted crew are great though. I mean, if we were all like (I can\\'t remember her name, she is so innocuous) well, then, we wouldn\\'t have a movie or any color to the world, would we? <br /><br />The most dishonest of the lot is Armand. Watch the cigarette in his first scene with Albert in drag. Williams is obviously using it to symbolize that he is, in fact, hiding something from his life-partner, and that \"something\" is Rodrigo- note his eyes when he communicates with the waiter in the restaurant scene. I mention this because The Birdcage is about deceit, some funny, some not. It is about people trying to be what they aren\\'t to please someone else and of course failing. Along the way, this film is a lot of fun. It is a sympathetic look at a life style most of us wouldn\\'t otherwise see, and that\\'s worth a lot.<br /><br />This is a great ensemble. Good actors, an excellent script, an interesting premise. A very very good film.<br /><br />But here\\'s my question, after all is said and done, why does Armand tell Katherine at the end that \"we are very proud of him\" in reference to Val? While I understand Val\\'s motives, why would a parent be proud of dishonesty, of urging denial of who one is, of plain stupidity in expecting (no matter the outcome of one evening) that his father in law could be eternally fooled? Yes, I know, I know. It\\'s all plot and not real, but still, I would have scratched that line, as there is no supporting evidence that Val- the center of this tornado- is anything but selfish.<br /><br />That said, I like this film.',\n",
       " \"What makes this movie so wonderful is how good a job Robin Williams and Nathan Lane do as portraying loving, dedicated parents. Aside from the amazing soundtrack and the fun antics, it is their sheer goodness as human beings that stays in your head for a long time.<br /><br />A fun thing to do is compare this movie to La Cage Aux Folles and see how different characters are interpreted differently. The son in the Birdcage is a much more complex character than the one in La Cage, and a lot of the movie is about him accepting his identity. The daughter, on the other hand, is much more of a three dimensional character in La Cage.<br /><br />The other nice thing about this movie is that unlike in the original, you end up liking the girls parents to some extent. They actually do have a lot in common with the heroes. That isn't true in La Cage, where the girl's father seems to be almost sinister\",\n",
       " 'The Birdcage is so hilarious! Oh my goodness gracious, this movie just really leaves you gasping for breath because you can\\'t stop laughing.<br /><br />Past the \"Fosse, Fossees\" and \"John Wayne imitations\", this movie can be seen in a deeper level. It addresses the controversial topic of homosexuality and how people who are gay or lesbian are just like any other people. Nathan Lane plays the part of a woman so well that I still find myself forgetting that SHE is a HE.<br /><br />The chemistry and interaction of the characters was played out so nice that the main message is clear. Amidst the sound of a nightclub, the first words the audience hears is \"We are family...\" This movie reminds people that no family is perfect.It shows the similarities between the contrasting serious and traditional family versus the lively, unorthodox family. Each family had its peculiarities and it shows the reality of family life. It is the love and genuine care for each other that makes up a family.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve watched this movie countless times and never get bored. It provides sheer entertainment and some of the best one-liners I\\'ve heard in a movie. It is equal opportunity in its derogatory remarks and racism, and that\\'s part of the charm. People get too worked up over stereotypes and \"being offended\" but they shouldn\\'t -- this is a movie, not a political commentary. The actors have done a superb job of creating humour out of an awkward situation -- two men who happen to be gay, live together, own a business and must \"play it straight\" for the benefit of their son\\'s in-laws.<br /><br />I think I understand why the critical review has been mediocre -- it\\'s likely because critics keep comparing \\'The Birdcage\\' with the original \\'La Cage Aux Folles\\'. I wish critics would rate a movie for what it is, and not for what it compares to. \\'The Birdcage\\' as a stand-alone movie is witty, funny, silly, and entertaining. And that\\'s what makes it so enjoyable! It\\'s one of my favourite comedies and I can watch it over and over again.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s a situation comedy reminiscent of Charley\\'s Aunt and equally as funny. In both scripts a man impersonates a woman in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion to an important event. The results are side-splitting. Nathan Lane has the plum part as the flamboyant petulant drag queen (Albert) while Robin Williams as his partner Armand manages to maintain some credulity in otherwise outrageous and complicated situations. The story bounces along at a nice speed. but tends to sag when Armand meets his ex-wife in her office and they do a little song and dance routine. I didn\\'t see much point in that. Of course the story climaxes in the dinner party scene when the two families come together in the apartment above the Birdcage Night Club. Ostensibly all erotic statues, paintings. carvings and other paraphernalia have been removed prior to dinner to create the right impression, but somehow or other the porcelain soup bowls decorated with men in erotic poses seem to have been overlooked and the patterns are quickly covered over in a frantic serving of chowder. The scene in which everybody joins in singing \"I could have danced all night\" is a high spot and their friend who acts as the butler for the night has a lovely comedy role as he stumbles about because he is not used to wearing shoes. Earlier in the film Armand tries to teach Albert how to sit, walk and act like a man. It\\'s an hilarious situation....an impossibility for Albert who is so steeped in his effeminate mannerisms. All in all an enjoyable presentation, but I have the feeling the original French version which I saw many years ago had more excitement in it and the farcical situations much more humorous.',\n",

Nathan Lane certainly has his fey acting abilities in tact, but he has no one to play against with Williams being as wooden as that living room cross. The other actors play caricatures of their roles in the same silly, stilted and inauthentic way as Williams. Tedious, with only a couple of truly funny moments. The lovely costuming and sets are totally wasted on this unemotionally nuanced affair.

He\\'s there for the disappointments and the heroic moments of these actors\\x97yes, the movie proves that even background players are truly actors. His use of clips from the feature films these extras have performed in is illuminating and hilarious.

       " 'Here\\'s another film in which I totally go against the critics - both professional and on this board, who take themselves too seriously at times. They hated this sequel to \"The Blues Brothers,\" but I enjoyed it very much. They need to chill a bit and realize the purpose of this film: simply a tribute to the music.<br /><br />How could any fan of \"blues,\" not like this? I mean, look at all the great performers in this film and how much better does it get to have all of them join in for a couple of jam sessions at the end? The movie sports a \"Who\\'s Who\" of modern-day blues musicians and singers and also is directed by John Landis, who has directed some of the most entertaining films of the last 25 years.<br /><br />Plus, it was simply a funny movie with two funny guys - Dan Akyroyd and John Goodman - and a really neat-looking little kid in J. Evan Bonifant who really makes me laugh. Just looking at this 10-year-old dancing is his Blues Brothers outfit alone is worth a number of laughs. Some of the characters in here are so outrageous they would be tough to describe. The car chases, the dances and clothing and over-the-top story all add up to two hours of lamed-brained fun. No, this isn\\'t Shakespeare and it wasn\\'t mean to be. It\\'s a much nicer-edged movie than the first Blues Brothers, too. Unfortunately, too many people want \"edgy\" material all the time .<br /><br />Not only are the characters colorful, so is the cinematography, making it both a visual and audio treat. So....just look at it as a blue concert with laughs, and, hopefully, you\\'ll enjoy it.',\n",
       " 'Contrary to popular opinion, this is not a sequel. It is supposed to be a tribute to the original. People who bash this movie without reading Aykroyd\\'s interviews are ignorant to the intent here. This movie was originally to be a sequel back in 1981 just before Belushi died. When that happened, the idea for another adventure fell away. But after almost two decades, Aykroyd wanted to do something to revisit the classic film and pay homage to his friend and co-star Belushi, so he assembled this \"Concert Movie\", which is supposed to be all about THE MUSIC, not the story. The only reason a story was put in was to keep it moving from musical number to musical number, because everyone knows that straight concert films are pretty boring, even if you really like the performer(s). So here it is, for the true Blues Brothers fans to enjoy. P.S.-And if your problem with the plot was some of the cartoony style actions that occur (Cabel being pulled heavenward and his clothes magically \"changing\", et cetera), remember that the original had the same things. In the first one the entire band\\'s clothing \"magically\" changes for a concert, but if you know that this is merely a representation of the character\\'s psychological state and not a literal change, then the film works much better. The same idea works for the much-maligned \"zombie\" sequence near the end at Queen Mousette\\'s mansion. Also, people complain about the Bluesmobile in this film being able to drive underwater. Well, in the first film the car flew, performed flips, and was nearly indestructible. In fact, if you watch the DVD of the first film, you find in the deleted scenes and \"Making-of\" section that the Bluesmobile is supposed to be \"magic\", because it was parked each night inside a power transformer. How is that for cheesiness on the first film? So that also explains Elwood\\'s ability to smuggle himself in the dash of the car in this one, and the car being able to crash land from a fiery loop-de-loop at the fairgrounds. Even though I wish this film could have been a little edgier and darker in tone like the original, I do find its bold and effective use of color to be magnificent and fascinating. Perhaps this film has a little more depth than people expect, so they incorrectly perceive it to be a lackluster and shallow mindnumbing entertainment. I know better .......

I have seen this film at least 20 times and get the same pleasure from it each time. Aretha Franklin\\'s voice and the musical abilities of almost the entire cast would carry any film, but this one doesn\\'t need it. The story might not be completely developed (euphemism) but the Russian mobsters and GI Joes scenes are gutbustingly funny. Also, for anyone who has ever listened to \"modern\" music and wondered where the world was going to, Dan Akroyd\\'s motivational speech is something to behold.

       " \"I found Ackroyd to be completely horrible. He looked more like Joe Friday than Elwood Blues. His Chicago accent was forced, the dialog moved through at a horribly slow pace. There was absolutely zero comic timing in this movie. Every scene in the movie, including the musical numbers, took too long-from Elwood talking to the Penguin, to the Car chases-long shots of police cars-to the car-under-the-water routing-to the 50 car pile up that seemed to take 10 minutes.<br /><br />The musical numbers-the lifeblood of the original-were completely devoid of soul. Aretha Franklin's lip-syncing in particular was horrible. Matt Guitar Murphy looked more like a broken down old man than the body-builder he did in the original. Who could believe that the `Dunn and Cropper' radio talk show could possibly exist when they both seemed to be reading off of cue cards the entire movie?<br /><br />The things that we funny and subtle in the first film-Elwood's parking ability, Jake's transformation at the hands of Reverend Cleophus, the miracle performance of the Bluesmobile, the new jobs of the former band members, were hackneyed and overdone in this film.<br /><br />The lack of energy from the band, though, is the coffin nail for this film.<br /><br />They perform with such little life that CGI animation of a skeleton riding a skeletal horse over the stage has to be imposed during their rendition of `Ghost Rider.' This comes from the same Blues Brothers band that made the theme to Rawhide sound like a hit twenty years ago.<br /><br />Finally, the movie seems too bright and too clean. The original took place at night for the most part, and seemed dungier. This film is shiny and clean and that just doesn't feel right. The new Bluesmobile didn't even look right until Elwood littered up the dashboard with trash, and-get this-the cigarette lighter worked!<br /><br />Other fatal flaws: dumbing-down Elwood Blues, inserting a kid into the cast, having Elwood eat something other than dry, white toast, the shaving-cream-ball schtick, no SCMODS, no lines like `Man, I haven't been pulled over in six months.' All the jokes hit you in the face-like they all have to be explained. Complete bomb.<br /><br />\",\n",

BB 2000, I thought, can\\'t be as good, but it must be worth seeing.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />I have tried, but I regret to say that I can find no redeeming features for this movie whatsoever. Not one. The dialogue which once was cool and sharp is stilted, forced, wholly unrecognisable as everyday English. The addition of the little kid and the black \"forgotten\" brother was pointless pandering to political correctness and family appeal. The car chases were overblown without being entertaining, and the plot was sadly not even laughable. I only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about. No chance. Even the usually excellent John Goodman was well below par, and this is to say nothing of the washed up Ackroyd.<br /><br />Terribly photographed, crippled by being utterly devoid of plot, jokes, charisma and with even the music shoehorned in with no thought to aesthetics or taste, I can honestly say that BB2K ranks alongside root canal work as the least pleasant way one could ever spend time. This film took me two long hours closer to my death. I suggest you do not let it do the same to you.',\n",

You know you shouldn't make a sequel when most of your original cast looks like they have been embalmed. The original had John Lee Hooker, this piece of trash has Jonny Lang?! I'm sorry, but John Goodman, Joe Morton, and that little kid do not have a tenth of the talent that John Belushi and John Candy would have on their worst day.

       " \"I love the first film. The second - well, as we all know, we don't have John Belushi with us anymore, which is one strike right there. The filmmakers made the good choices of John Goodman and Joe Morton as backup singers. Had they stopped there, the film would have been much better.<br /><br />Instead, a kid was thrown into the mix. An orphan, of course. Awwww. Elwood Blues is supposed to act as mentor for the kid (Buster), but forgets to return Buster to the orphanage, getting half the cops in the country and several mean orphanage workers on his tail.<br /><br />Now, the whole point of the first Blues Brothers film is that these guys can't stay out of trouble. The character of Elwood, with or without Brother Jake, is going to get himself in it up to his eyeballs. The whole story about Elwood being chased for kidnapping is ludicrous. Elwood is going to get in trouble for one thing or another. It didn't have to be kidnapping.<br /><br />Thus, we end up listening to a prepubescent kid squalling the lines of a damned good song, one that was belted out by three fine singers (Aykroyd, Goodman, and Morton), thus ruining the whole effect. It's no wonder that the Blues Brothers lost the Battle of the Bands - I'd have booed them offstage for bringing a kid into the mix.<br /><br />There's an cloying, aren't-we-cute gushiness about Buster and his little Blues Brothers outfit that almost gags me. I loved the musical numbers and all the guest artists - and what an impressive group they are! - so I can't understand why the filmmakers would drag down the storyline by introducing a kid, and throwing in all the clichés associated with a small child interacting with adults. The kid is precocious. He's (supposedly, though I see no evidence of it) a good singer. He gives a pep talk at the crucial time. He's easy to bond with. It just doesn't work.<br /><br />I will watch it for the music and for Elwood's highly inventive method of parallel parking, but I fast-forward through Buster's scenes.\",\n",

When they meet Queen Muset that is when things really go wrong! I;d had an inkling when those skully horses lept out of the storm cloud! Many actors from 'The Blues Brothers' (1980) made a welcome re-appearance, but even they couldn't save this from this film being a flaw! The only redeeming feature is the music but there is not enough of it to constitute watching. If you haven't seen the first one, by all means watch this but given half a chance watch the first one first, give this film a miss. Nia Peeples was the only reason I watched this (principally) But her usual classy acting was let down by her co-stars (the noticeably and unusual wooden Dan Aykroyd) plus her great figure was mostly hidden by a police uniform!

Whenever I feel a twinge of nostalgia, I no longer have to drive down to Memphis; I just drop in this DVD -- and smile.<br /><br />It\\'s obvious to me that the cast of this movie was \"on a mission from God\" to leave a legacy to those who come after and have never known the real thing.

After being escorted outside, he stood beside the road, eagerly awaiting his brother Jake to pick him up. Several hours go by and Jake had not arrived. Elwood waited until the next morning, when the warden finally came out and told him the awful news: Jake had passed away. Elwood received a ride home from Matara, a colleague of his old bandmember Willie. Once back in town, Elwood went to Malvern Gasperon\\'s used car lot and set his sites on a classic police cruiser, similar to the one he had in the last adventure. But it was gonna cost $500, which he didn\\'t have. Next, Elwood visits Mother Mary Stigmata at the new orphanage, since the old one had long since been demolished. Right away, Elwood learns that his old buddy Curtis had died. He also learns that Curtis had an illegitimate son. That\\'s also when Elwood meets a young, sarcastic orphan named Buster. Mother Mary wanted Elwood to spend some time with the youngster--whether he wanted to or not.<br /><br />Elwood attempted to ditch the kid, though unsuccessfully, and seek out Curtis\\' son. He found him at the police station. He was Commander Cabel \"Cab\" Chamberlain. Elwood introduced himself, then told his \"sort-of brother\" that he was thinking of putting the band back together and asked if he\\'d like to join. He also asks to borrow $500 for a car. But Cab had the goods on Elwood and his late brother Jake. He refused, and personally kicked him out of the office. Outside, Buster picked his pocket and gave the wallet to Elwood, which ironically contained $500. So, Elwood purchased the police cruiser then he and Buster go for a very slow cruise. They stop off at Willie\\'s strip club to try and convince Willie rejoin the band. Willie was hesitant, because the Russian mafia was watching him. But, Elwood and the bartender, Mack McTeer, bound and gag two Russian mobsters and leave them in the alley. This did not sit well with their leader, who demanded vengeance against Elwood and Willie; Elwood gives Mack an opportunity to perform at the club and sees he has talent. Just then, the Russians arrive and shoot up the club, then torch it. Luckily all the strippers, patrons, Matara, Elwood, Mack, Willie and Buster escape in time. Mack and Willie join the band. Next, Elwood tracks down the other members of the band: Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy, Donald \"Duck\" Dunne, Tom \"Bones\" Malone, Murph, Mr. Fabulous, and \"Blue Lou\" Marini and, in his own crude and crass way, convinces them to rejoin. Elwood even had Mack and Buster fitted with their own Blues suits. Now, all they needed was a gig. Unbeknownst to them, the Illinois state police and the Russian mafia were after them.<br /><br />Maury Sline, their old booking agent, managed to book them a gig at a county fair in Kentucky, and, an opportunity to play at Queen Mousette\\'s Battle of the Bands at her club in Louisiana. So, Elwood, Mack and Buster in the new Bluesmobile, and the band in tow, hit the road. Always managing to stay one step ahead of a furious Cab and the entire Illinois police force. They play at the fair in Kentucky, but learned they wanted a bluegrass band, and not a blues band. So they played bluegrass, blues style. All the while Cab and the cops watched the stage, but monster trucks and a storm proved the perfect distraction; the Blues brothers and the band manage to elude the cops at a local tent revival, with the Reverend Cleophus James. When Cab arrived, something extraordinary happened. It was a miracle, some say. He had a revelation. His destiny became clear. He donned a nifty Blues outfit and joined the band. But the rest of the police force weren\\'t buying it, so they chased the Blues Brothers band all the way to Louisiana where they competed in Queen Mousette\\'s Battle of the Bands--and lost to the Louisiana Gator Boys. Well before long, Elwood and the gang found themselves surrounded by every cop in a thousand mile radius, as well as the Russian mafia. And worst of all, Mother Mary Stigmata! There was nothing left to do but run. Buster had a plan. While Mack and Cab created a diversion on stage, Elwood and Buster made a run for it in the Bluesmobile followed by a very long cavalcade of police cars.<br /><br />Blues Brothers 2000--what can I say? It was pretty good. It started off very properly with a proper dedication to John Belushi, Cab Calloway and John Candy. Dan Aykroyd returns as Elwood Blues, everyone\\'s favorite crafty Blues con. John Goodman is on board as Mighty Mack McTeer. Joe Morton is Cab. J. Evan Bonifant is Buster. Frank Oz returns as the warden. And the late Kathleen Freeman returns as Mary Stigmata. Familiar faces Aretha Franklin and James Brown are here too. Belushi\\'s absence from this film is definitely noticeable, but I think it\\'s good they made Elwood a more central character, since in the original it was obvious Jake was the central character. They gave Elwood a chance to build. But personally, this wasn\\'t much of a sequel, but rather a rehash of the first film. But if you liked the first film and would like to see a jazzy update, then Blues Brothers 2000 is for you. I recommend it. Like they say, the Lord works in mysterious ways.',\n",
       " 'Lets start with the good, The acting by Beverly Lynne was convincing and entertaining, The lovely Ms. Lynne has really stepped up her game and is showing real talent. Michael Pare always seems to play the same type of character. Strong Willed, rebel, ala Streets of Fire and Eddie and the Cruisers. In this movie he plays a detective and he really goes through the motions but he is the best male actor in the vehicle, Charles Durning must have lost a bet as he seemed comatose throughout the movie.<br /><br />The bad: The plot, made NO SENSE, Note to production company, if you are going to mention a name like Polycarp EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT! I cant give any spoilers here because the movie never came me a plot. This movie is a waste of time and if not for the aforementioned Beverly Lynne this movie would have been a complete waste of time.<br /><br />The Ugly: I will never get that 85 minutes of my life back, so when I am in my death bed I will regret all the things I could have done other than watch Megacrap, but at least it will make me think of the beautiful Beverly Lynne and at least that will bring a smile.<br /><br />Bottom line this not a cult classic, a blockbuster nor is it worthy of B-movie status. It might be shown as a Double Feature with Battlefield Earth...',\n",

Polycarp aka Kinky Killers will bore your senses to death.<br /><br />You know those movies that look and feel like someone took a pickup truck down to the Sunset Strip and rounded up a bunch of prostitutes and whores, gave them scripts, drugs and money, and then said: NOW ACT! Well, this is one of 'those' movies.<br /><br />After about two minutes into this cheese-fest, you start feeling like you are watching a really bad porno flick. The directing, the lines, the cast, just give it away that the movie was governed end-to-end by the porn industry.<br /><br />Then (since they rounded up a lot of prostitutes off of the Sunset Strip), there is that problem where too many characters look alike - white, dumb and blond. You quickly become confused as to which dumb blond is getting hacked on now, but you resign yourself to not really caring since the movie is just so bad.<br /><br />The story is completely inane. The acting is so bad you can't believe God made people this stupid. There is no Good versus Evil, since everyone in the movie is evil; so does it really matter which evil wins? At the 30 minute mark you get the overwhelming feeling to just stop watching and try something else, but you decide to see it through. Next time remember to not be so heroic. At around 4/5 into the movie it actually does become a dedication to pornography, witchcraft, Satan and sex-magick. Everyone just starts having sex with whoever, I kid you not.<br /><br />The ending is as bad or worse than the beginning, leaving you with the typical WTF?! puzzlement. With a title of Kinky Killers (which by the way is meaningless) I suppose you should expect something sexual in nature, but this rode right over to the pornography arena in the last 20 minutes making it unfit for children and teens to view.<br /><br />A polycarp is a talking fish.

Then there is the ever so needed gratuitous breast shot, that pretty much make the movie( mind that none of them are nice). The story for this film is, confusing to say the least. One minute people are dying, next there having rough intercourse. By the time you get to the middle the story goes from weird to just completely out of this world. By the time we were nearing the end i said \"This title is completely irrelevant \" then once you see the final scene it all makes sense.

Sadder still is the participation of Charles Durning, who really is a good actor, but does three scenes which make absolutely no sense so they can put his name on the DVD cover and trick you into thinking you are seeing a better movie.<br /><br />The movie ends with the few surviving characters being captured by the cult, who mangle out some explanation about how they are trying to summon Lucifer by boiling human body parts in a vat.<br /><br />There are a lot of sex scenes in this movie, some of which almost work.

The 3rd act makes you realize they've been holding together a mess that was breaking at the seams... Good for them and Brooke Lewis who plays against her bombshell casting perfectly. She is without a doubt a a indie star on the rise and an actress to watch. Mary O'Rourke is wasted in her role. She is cute as hell.

The script touches on many universal themes: family, friendship, depleted fishing grounds, health care, problem drinking. The performances are wonderful, especially Cherry Jones, Robert Knott, and Tara Devon Gallagher. I saw Swimmers at the Seattle International Film Festival and I strongly recommend it. It just won the Portugese film festival so I am hopeful it will get a distributor as it deserves to be seen by a wide audience.

The only good thing that happens in the whole movie is the friendship forged between the little girl and the maniac. Then the maniac decides to dye the little girls hair black without the parents permission. Who does that?<br /><br />The movie starts at the bottom of a hill and goes down from there.

Set in a small town, it tells the story of a Chesapeake Bay waterman's family as they pass through a crisis. The movie is superbly cast, with both famous (Cherry Jones) and unknown actors giving fine, nuanced performances. The Chesapeake Bay currently suffers significant ecological degradation from farm runoff, industrial pollution, and other factors. This has severely impacted crab, oyster, and fish populations and hence the livelihood of traditional Bay water-men. It is against this backdrop of economic struggle that the movie's story is told. Already poor and unable to afford health insurance, the family is pushed past the breaking point when their young daughter suffers a swimming injury and needs surgery.\",\n",

The story centers on a five-person family as told through the eyes of its youngest member, an 11 year-old girl. The characters and motivations of the mother, father, daughter and one of her brothers are very well-developed, as is that of an unrelated woman that comes to their small Maryland coastal town with some baggage of her own. The story plays beautifully, its underlying tensions coming to a head near the end of the film. Thought-provoking -- my husband and I were talking about it hours after we\\'d seen it.

The sub-plots intricately weave together to bring about the conclusion to this thoroughly enjoyable and brilliant piece of work. I loved the film and found each character well cast.

For such a short film, all the major characters are amazingly complex, as they captivate the audience with powerful transitions wrought by financial and social crises. Director Doug Sadler has extracted some of the best acting out of some of Hollywood's most underutilized talent: Cherry Jones playing Julia Tyler, the strong, persevere-at-all-costs mother; Robert Knott playing Will Tyler, the cash-strapped father who loves his family, but who falls apart and seeks escape when his plans for providing for his family fail; Sarah Paulson playing Merrill, a young woman with psychological problems rooted in her childhood; and new-to-Hollywood child actress Tara Devon Gallagher playing 11-year-old Emma Tyler, whose sudden need for a medical procedure becomes the source of the crises and redemption, and through whose both simple and profound perspective the beautiful story is narrated.\",\n",

Since we live across the Chesapeake Bay from the Eastern Shore, where the movie is set, we are familiar with the area, the lifestyles, the economics and such. Swimmers captures the intensity of the Chesapeake Bay watermen in the declining estuary, and the rhythm and flow of the water and the people that make their living on it. I was immediately sucked into the intensity of the movie, and the innerness of the people. The acting is so good and the filming, timing, sights and sounds are so well done, that I forget I was watching a movie and felt that I was sitting next to over looking over the shoulder of the person (actor) in the scene. The subject is intense, and the plot is the personalities of the family members, their thoughts and their interactions. It's a movie that will peel back the onion of your memories and deep personal feelings. It's definitely not a feel good movie. It's much more a feel what is very real about you and people you are closest to movie.\",\n",

The small town setting is wonderful and the economic plight of the oysterman is painful to watch...the disappearing way of life that is so common in many rural areas.<br /><br />I was stunned by the actors performances and the beauty of the setting juxtaposed with the pain in their lives.

Financial pressures and strains from Will\\'s drinking issues take the family to the breaking point and everyone is affected by the struggle.

The point of view stays with a wise and sensitive little girl which creates a innocent delight and a freshness to the total ambiance of the film. The setting could be anywhere in small town America in any working class family, yet this film is about a waterman's family and what they do in a time of crisis.

There are so many nuances in the performances its hard to know where to start, but let's just say the women drive the action here, with a wonderful debut in Tara Gallagher as Emma, the eleven year old narrator of the tale, and Cherry Jones as her mother Julia, and Sarah Paulson as the emotionally damaged Merrill. These casting choices were excellent, and all bring an understated core to their performances that are perfectly drawn out by Director Doug Sadler working from his own screenplay. Robert Knott as Julia's down and out husband Will Tyler evokes a younger Robert Duvall or Ed Harris, and is pitch perfect in his portrayal of a man trying very hard against odds that are not breaking his way. If you are looking for an antidote to the violence and mayhem that passes for movie-making these days, you can take heart that in this fantastic film solid writing and acting, and the focused emotions of small town life in America, make for a terrific story and one that you should not miss.\",\n",

I was particularly impressed with how the Merill character turned out-- she could have SO easily been the stereotypical vampy-sexy-screwed-up character, but she was so fragile and so NOT in charge of herself while still remaining appealing-- and with Cherry Jones, of course (\"Sit down, Shelly\"), and Sean Hatosy is heartbreakingly dear -- could he possibly be anything other than a small-town cop searching for stronger self-esteem? <br /><br />I also am amazed that a movie with such seemingly humble and unglamorous themes has such a breathless pace -- no one could ever fault this sleeper/swimmer for being \"slow.\"<br /><br />I am eager to see who is smart enough to pick up this film -- this young writer/director is going places, and some fortunate and talented people are going along for the ride/swim.',\n",

I wouldn\\'t recommend it to the casual viewer, as it contains way too many scenes of the band\\'s personal lives to be interesting to the general public. <br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot, because it gives lots of insider info on a band that I\\'ve loved for over fifteen years. The most interesting part, and the one that most people will cite as the film\\'s centerpiece, concerns Steven Drozd\\'s frank discussion about his heroin addiction. The scene is as chilling as anything you\\'ve ever seen, watching Steven cook up a rig full of smack has to be the wildest thing I\\'ve seen in a film in years. <br /><br />There isn\\'t enough concert footage here, but two recent (excellent) shows are featured, Coachella 2004 and the Stubb\\'s show in Austin, TX. I would have enjoyed more scenes of that classic show in Austin TX, mainly because I was there, in the front, and it was the most fun I\\'ve ever had at a concert in my life. Their Coachella set (I was there, too) was way too short, mostly consisting of Wayne trying to surf the crowd in a huge bubble (which was totally cool). I think they played four songs before they were rushed off so the Cure could take forever to come on. blah.<br /><br />The thing I enjoyed most about this film was the insight it gives on what it\\'s like to be a \"rock star\". Wayne and his wife don\\'t live in a mansion, and their lives seem wonderfully normal. This was refreshing, and it certainly beats the hell out of watching Metallica argue for two hours. <br /><br />The Flaming Lips have arguably one of the finest albums ever made, The Soft Bulletin (if you can find the vinyl version, get it no matter how much you got to spend). While I don\\'t think this film will open them up to a wider audience, fans of the band won\\'t be disappointed.',\n",
       " \"'Fearless Freaks' is an excellent documentary that's sure to please longtime fans like myself as well as newer fans, and will probably win them a fair batch of new followers. As 'Watch me Jumpstart' does with Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices, it paints an intimate portrait of head Lip Wayne Coyne as a family man and member of his community. We get plenty of interesting background into Coyne's early family life and nascent artistic aspirations. Interviews with band members, family members, and friends are inter-cut with raw live footage of the group's often very visually fascinating performances. The pace is just right to keep the viewer always entertained and never bored, but not at a breakneck, highly edited MTV-ish pace. My only complaint about the movie is that details on the band's history and specific works by them are rather skimpy. I would have liked to have gotten more details such as Wayne explaining his inspirations for various songs, discussions about their creative process, studio stories, and the like.<br /><br />Drummer Steven Drozd becomes the other major character in this movie when his addiction to heroin is frankly and almost shockingly discussed and portrayed on film. Without giving too much away, this subplot comes to an apparently happy ending, and the movie concludes on a high note, with The Flaming Lips on stage playing before their enthralled fans, on the verge of another artistic triumph. Here's to The Flaming Lips.\",\n",
       " 'Fearless Freaks is the story of \"the punks finally taking acid\" featuring the alternative band, The Flaming Lips. It is a masterful explosion of bizarre rock & roll footage collaged into a documentary form. Each \\'Lip\\' goes into detail how they became part of the group and their personal struggles throughout their years. In a way, the film is a blueprint of how to become a rock star; make music with your friends, film every show, make loud experimental music, use smoke and fire when you lack talent, find a filmmaker to follow you around, crank call record companies, tour , tour , tour and you\\'ll finally make it big. Every Flaming Lip fan and starving rocker will appreciate this fiery saga. Freaks is filmed by their longtime director Brad Beesley(Okie Noodling). It looks deep into their origins in Oklahoma City and is culled from over 400 hours of video footage the \\'Lips\\' had in their archives of early shows, growing up, pictures and show posters. Beesley signed on to follow the band in the early 1990\\'s and made many of their early music videos. Produced by Minnesotans, Rick Fuller and edited by Jolynn Garnes.',\n",
       " 'The interesting thing about \"The Fearless Freaks\" is the difference between the style of Brad Beesley\\'s film-making and the production process of the Lips\\' albums. Wayne Coyne\\'s music is weird, yes-- even chaotic, but it is carefully put together and endlessly tweaked, elevating the raw elements of songwriting (guitar chords, sung melody) into a mesmerizing digital orchestra of sorts. Beesley\\'s documentary, however, is satisfied with gritty, hand-held 16mm footage of (usually) Coyne pontificating. It\\'s odd that such futuristic, unconventional music-making would make such good source material for old-school, back-to-basics film-making. The most interesting part of this documentary, rather than the heroin scene with Steven Drozd, is Wayne revisiting his old Long John Silver\\'s and enlisting two young children to reenact a robbery which launches him into a spiel about the rather un-poetic reality of death. It, like the rest of the film, is an incredible snapshot of some true oddballs in the American music scene.',\n",

However, this is because I am a former addict. But I still think it was unnecessary to be so graphic; but he truly shares the perils of heroin addiction in the most real way.<br /><br />I do wonder how the movie will turn out. I can't believe the amount of energy Wayne possesses toward his projects. I found him to be a great role model (I am an artist myself, and quite lazy by comparison).<br /><br />Only one more complaint. Like in many documentaries, they will tease you with the beginning of a wonderful song, then speak over it, or cut away. I could have used less talk and more music, since this is what the documentary is ultimately about; well beside their lives and the creative process.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film. Oh, and yes, it is a bit too long; but it only proves how engaged the filmmaker is in the project.\",\n",

You could have easily come up with a better transition device (I am a video editor by trade so I think I can be critical of this flaw) <br /><br />When the film doesn\\'t drop the ball and effectively tells the stories of Flaming Lips members\\' families/relatives/siblings it can compete with any other human interest documentary out there.

       " 'When a group of alien agents from a dying planet come to Earth under the leadership of Isis (Amelia Cooke) to build a portal to connect both worlds, the warrior Rykker (Mark Dacascos) opposes and defends the earthlings. He rescues the teenager Julie (Emma Lahana), whose family was murdered by the invaders, and together they try to destroy the portal and avoid the invasion commanded by the cruel Saylon (Billy Zane).<br /><br />\"Alien Agent\" is an unoriginal and forgettable B-movie, with a terrible screenplay that begins the story like a sequel of a pilot of a TV show. The situations are only motive for car chases, explosions, shootings and stupid fights. The story begins with a car chase when two aliens fire their machine guns against Rykker but never hit the hero; suddenly one of them wisely jumps on Rykker car to struggle against the hero in a ridiculous sequence. The rest of the story follows the low standard. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"A Invasão\" (\"The Invasion\")',\n",

They're all humans who have been killed, but somehow their bodies taken over by the invaders. I was unable to waste enough time to see this thing to its end.<br /><br />Other commenters may help here.\",\n",
       " 'In a nutshell so that you don\\'t have to read the rest of my crap if you don\\'t want to: Old story. Aliens are having problems in their world and so they come to ours to bug us or take over, or something. I dunno. So an alien agent is sent to stop them from their diabolical schemes.<br /><br />When not chairing the \"Iron Chef\" Mark Dacascos. does action B-movies which are, in my opinion, usually better than most B-movies but yet always seem to fall just short of their potential. This one is no exception. All the pieces are there; just needed a little bit more intelligence in the writing and better direction. Case in point: our hero steals a police car and was asked by his companion why he did it. He replied that he wanted to hear the police reports. This was so obviously a lame excuse since the cost of attracting so much attention to himself far outweighed the benefits. Besides, he could simply have used or gotten a scanner of his own (he had a hideout full of crap). More likely the director wanted a car chase and this was his best excuse to get one. In another scene a lot of people were killed for no good reason other than to steal a truck. Why would you do that and draw unwanted attention to yourself? More likely the director needed a mass murder at this juncture and this was his best excuse for one. I wanted to like this movie, and I did \"somewhat\" (I liked the early scene with the alien chick on the overpass; at that point the movie looked very promising) but there were some inconsistencies that bugged me. In the first fight scene the hero fought very well; expertly. Then there was a later fight scene where he appeared to not know how to fight at all. If the director wanted the bad guy to get the better of him he could have done it without making him look like he forgot how to fight altogether (he basically stood there and took an ass whipping).<br /><br />Dacascos obviously is a talented martial artist. More so than Van Damme or Seagal. And yet -as luck or fate would have it- never achieved even their level of success. Ironic that he\\'s probably better known from a cooking show than from what he does best. Kick ass. Ahh well, life has a sense of humor. All I can say for Alien Agent is that it\\'s better than most B-movies which may or may not be saying much. Why don\\'t you be the judge? Love, Boloxxxi.',\n",
       " \"Good B-scifi film with an awful title. The plot has an alien race trying to build a worm hole terminal on earth so they can leave their dying planet and forcibly take over the earth. They only thing stopping them is an single alien who wants revenge. What can I say its turn your brain off time at the old homestead. The best way to describe this is a way better than average SCIFI Channel original film. Its a better than average TV movie that just works with in its limits and goes. Certainly its nothing you haven't seen before but its sense of seriousness makes it worth your time in front of the TV screen. If there is any flaw its the invulnerability the aliens have, it kind of takes the edge off the danger. Still if this had a better title people would be eating this up.\",\n",
       " \"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />I've been reviewing films on IMDb for ten years now. I've reviewed well over a thousand. I've seen and reviewed all sorts of films. Some are adaptations of great novels or cult TV shows that were destined to become great films. Some may have been true life stories that had to be made into a film. And others may have been less audacious, and simply been made to be a simple piece of escapist, B movie fun. That seems to have been the case with Alien Agent...but the result couldn't have been worse. Instead, it is a film that leaves one word wondering around in your mind: why? What was the point of it? What inspired a supposedly intelligent movie producer to think there was any chance it would be a big hit, either on the big screen or on DVD? Are there not loads of talented, up and coming young artists crying out for their big break, for whom the budget for this useless excuse for a film could have spring boarded their careers? What is the point of it? <br /><br />Mark Dascascos's career reads like a whole charge sheet of direct to DVD mediocrity, with the occasional supporting appearance in a big studio film that sees the light of day at a cinema screen. I haven't seen most of them, to be honest, and maybe there are some films in that barren landscape of filmic drudgery that would make this codswallop seem like a masterpiece (shudder.) But he's the lead star here, and that ain't great marketing potential to get your film noticed much. Then there's his co star Billy Zane, who just over ten years ago spoke with an elequted British accent in Titanic, the biggest film of all time in scope of scale and budget. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's careers have taken off quite grandly, fate has dealt him the unlucky hand and he gets to co star in drivel like this, where he first speaks with a weird American trucker accent before being magically transformed into a more smoothly spoken evil alien type guy.<br /><br />You'll notice I've forgone the traditional plot summary, which is too apathetic to make a fuss about. Some nonsense about an alien race from another planet that have developed a portal to our world to drain our natural resources and eventually enslave our species, which Dacascos's 'alien agent' must try and sort out. I could go on about this, and the atrociously bad acting, and the unbelievably cheap looking special effects (mainly, what appear to be sparkler sprinkles coming from the slain alien invaders) the even shoddier looking sets and the complete lack of any exciting action through out...but frustratingly, this is one of those films where I could tell from the trailer it was going to be rubbish and so, I kind of feel like I only have myself to blame to be honest.<br /><br />Alien Agent is one of those films that just makes you wonder why you even bother watching movies anymore. I know this is more of a rant than I should be wasting on a film of such unimportance but...I just can't figure out why anyone thought this would have appeal to anyone and, if there is, even with such an obviously low budget and B list cast, they made such a p!ss poor job of it. It's such a waste of time and, lets be honest, a waste of emerging talent. NO STARS\",\n",
       " \"The appearance of Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies and then Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon piqued my interest in the lady's earlier films and when this one came up cheap on DVD, I jumped at the chance to acquire it. I am glad I did. It is not the greatest film I have ever seen, but it is good fun and includes some good fight stuff. Michelle Yeoh looks terrific and does some great fight scenes, and all with a great sense of fun. This is one film not to be taken seriously and the result is a great way of spending 90 minutes. If you like mindless action with a touch of humour, then you could do a lot worse than this film. Check it out.\",\n",
       " \"I saw this for about the third time last night, mildly inebriated and had a wonderful time. It's essential viewing for Michelle Yeoh fans, as she gives one of her most ass kicking performances whilst looking sweet throughout. She plays a sort of female Indiana Jones type with nifty kung fu skills, and whups numerous bad folk from start to finish, ably supported by Tung Shing Yee. The plot is a standard heroic Chinese take on weaselly Japanese type affair, as our heroes seek to prevent the building of a poison gas factory in a mountain town and rescue its sympathetic leader Youda, well portrayed by Lowell Lo as a slightly weak and fuddled but basically good patriotic guy. Richard Ng provides the most obvious laughs with his swindler character, again, basically a good guy and the whole crew are an engaging lovable bunch. The Japanese are all pretty villainous and are helped out by leg fighting genius and veteran bad guy Hwang Jang Lee. The film is simply great entertainment throughout, with a fairly light tone and plenty of laughs. The choreography and stunt work is top notch, making for real thrills and the pace is fast. At times the budget seems lower than it should have been but this doesn't hurt too much, the only real problems are the final block and the underuse of Hwang Jang Lee. In the last twenty minutes or so the film goes into more of a battle mode and neglects the martial arts, which is a real shame. Criminally it does not give us a proper final fight scene and the conclusion is a tad unsatisfying. Also, Hwang Jang Lee doesn't get to do much of his trademark awesome leg work, nor is his character up to the standards of the thoroughly mean folks he has played in the past. It made me a bit sad, especially what with his roles in Drunken Master or Snake In The Eagles Shadow, to name just two. Another, more minor issue for me was that despite the copious amounts of bullets and arrows flying about, barely a drop of blood is seen in the movie. I don't expect Lone Wolf And Cub style violence in these films and I know the film was trying to be light hearted, but it definitely would have given the final third more of a punch. Still, these are small issues compared with how much joy I got out of watching this. Fans of Michelle Yeoh or Hong Kong action from the Eighties definitely need to check this one out.\",\n",
       " '\"Magnificent Warriors\" finds its leading star, Michelle Yeoh, in top form: her speed and dance-like grace make her fight scenes a pure pleasure to watch (she\\'s also good with a whip....and a rope....and a spear....well, you get the idea). And as a bonus, there is another girl, the beautiful and feisty Cindy Lau, who fights as well! Richard Ng, perhaps better known for his role in the \"Lucky Stars\" films, provides the comic relief, and he\\'s actually quite funny here. The action offers a good mix of martial arts and large-scale battle scenes, and the story is (after the first 30 minutes) engaging and at times even inspiring. The production is spectacular and the music score appropriately epic. If you want to see an Asian take (plus a female twist this time) on the Indiana Jones formula, this is a much better choice than Jet Li\\'s \"Dr. Wai And The Scripture With No Words\". (***)',\n",
       " \"And any fans of hers will want to see this thoroughly entertaining romp. A big-budget picture that doesn't skimp on plot or its sometimes-hilarious script in showcasing Ms. Yeoh's considerable talents (including a great scene with a whip!), THE MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS delivers on all counts. Don't miss!\",\n",
       " \"Magnificent Warriors is an enjoyable and entertaining movie with a lot to recommend it, especially the excellent, athletic prescence of the fantastic Michelle Yeoh. Still, it drags and feels a little limp in places. For instance, the two opening fights during the plot setup are explosive, impactful and a lot of fun, but after that nothing really happens action-wise until 20 minutes later.<br /><br />The film stop-starts all the way through, making it a bit frustrating for an experienced viewer. It's no more stop-starty or inconsistent than US or European action fare like Transporter or Red Siren, but it seems patchy and messy in comparison to other Hong-Kong adrenaline-rides like Full Contact or Yeoh's later Wing Chun. Both movies keep a consistent level of action without sacrificing their story lines.<br /><br />They also have strong, non-wacky story lines. Magnificent Warriors is a horrific mess in the plot department. Take Indiana Jones, substitute the Japanese for the Nazis and substitute Michelle Yeoh for Harrison Ford and you'd think it'd rock. You'd almost be right, but the director and his writers decided to try and make some political points with it and turn it into a patriotic pro-China movie...as such it gets kind of messy and biased.<br /><br />Still, it's a Michelle Yeoh film. If you're a fan, which I most certainly am, you won't be disappointed with this. Yeah, OK MW blows its two best fights in the first 20 minutes, but there's a lot of good solid action going on here, and though Yeoh isn't as central as I would have liked to preceedings (given she's the only one here who can act her way out of a paper bag) she has some fantastic set pieces and humorous lines to fight/charm her way through.<br /><br />If you like Michelle Yeoh, watch this, it's a good film and above all it's fun and she showcases both her fighting talent and her charm in equal measure. If you're indifferent to her and just want an OTT blast, there are much better HK actioners out there, you'd probably fare better with say Eastern Condors or Full Contact, both of which are off their rocker and full of chop-socky and gun-play.\",\n",
       " 'I found the blend of action and humor in this film to be very entertaining. Michelle Yeoh does some incredible stunts, including imaginative use of rope in one sequence. Richard Ng does some pretty slick moves too. Also the actress who plays Chin-Chin does some impressive fighting. If you like Michelle Yeoh films, or even Jackie Chan films, this really should be right up your alley. Incredible stunts, and very funny dialog, this was a real treat to watch.',\n",
       " 'The XTRO-trilogy (if you can call it that) is an odd phenomenon. The three movies are totally unrelated, except for the fact that they all were directed by Harry Bromley Davenport and they all deal with extra-terrestrial encounters. The first XTRO was a peculiar little sci-fi/horror/drama-gem. A weird mixture of genres, but a good flick nonetheless. XTRO II: The Second Encounter was a shameless ALIEN rip-off, solid in creature-terror, but over-all bad. And XTRO 3: Watch The Skies unfolds more like a 90 minutes episode of THE X-FILES mixed with military stuff and ripped details from PREDATOR. So go figure.<br /><br />Now, XTRO 3 is slightly better than the second one only because it actually has a bit of a plot. It has also another rather unique aspect: it\\'s a sort of alien-revenge-flick (there aren\\'t many of those, are there?) A group of expendable military misfits are send out to clean up a remote island, for the military has plans to build a base there. Soon they discover that there\\'s actually an all different purpose to their visit as they encounter an alien on that island.<br /><br />The actors are unknown & mediocre and the characters are all clichés. Except for Andrew\"Djinn\"Divoff. It\\'s nice to see him again, but his performance is rather unnoticeable, and you get the idea that he\\'s only any good when he can deliver witty one-liners. The camera-work is pretty bad too. The musical score is at times really cheap, but sometimes they surprisingly use the right scary sounds. But it was at those moments that I suspected they used parts from other movie\\'s soundtracks.<br /><br />As for the alien effects: they\\'re pretty good, especially the moving facial features. There are some decent gore-effects too, but the rest of the special effects look crappy.<br /><br />At times you will have to fight off boredom while watching this flick, but the occasional voice-over from the main character makes you want to know how it all will end. So, if your looking for an off-beat sci-fi quicky, XTRO 3 might be worth a watch. More demanding sci-fi fans should better ignore it.',\n",
       " 'A team of most unlikely Marines is sent to defuse any spent artillery rounds or unexploded bombs that might be left on an island that was used as a gunnery target. (Before that, it was an internment camp for Japanese citizens.) The island seems overrun by tame white rabbits. A detonation showers the team with human bones. (\"It was probably a graveyard.\") Some deranged old white guy shows up screaming, most likely mad. Another detonation blows the corner off a hidden cement shelter that oozes glop that seems to dissolve skin. An alien appears among them. In other words, things seem to be getting a little hairy.<br /><br />But then none of this really comes as a surprise because things have been hairy from the beginning, starting with the half dozen members of the team, a bunch of wise guys goofing on their new leader, a stern Lieutenant Commander wearing the wrong cap (he\\'s one grade below the scrambled-egg level). The Marines seem to dress any old way they want, wearing their caps backward like baseball hats. There\\'s a woman among them. She wears only what I believe is called a singlet. In one shot a Marine takes cover carrying a bolt-action rifle. One of the team openly smokes crack. They all look like bums.<br /><br />It\\'s not so much the wardrobe or props that turn this potentially interesting, if already familiar, story into the wreck that it is. It\\'s the clumsy writing and the indifferent direction. The gold is there but no one has separated it from the dross. I mean -- an island that has been deserted for fifty years. Scattered live ammunition. The left over camp in which human beings were forced to live during World War II. What a fascinating place to explore, all by itself. But no atmosphere is captured, no real mystery or suspense generated. They go ashore on this deserted island and everything begins to happen, one thing after another, really FAST, as if to prevent the audience from being bored because a scene lasts longer and is more revealing than a Head On commercial (\"apply directly to the forehead!\"). When I was a kid I explored an empty army base, Fort Hancock, NJ, and stumbled across a pile of live 20 millimeter shells abandoned in a swamp. Not knowing better, I tried juggling a few of the unstable things. Now -- in retrospect -- THAT was exciting. This isn\\'t. It\\'s less mystery movie than slasher.<br /><br />You can do a lot with a small budget, but you have to put some care into what you\\'re doing first.<br /><br />Utter tripe, badly acted, poorly executed.',\n",

One thing definitely is that \"Predator\" is a definite masterpiece when compared to this cheap, hokey and pitifully vapid effort. Even the actors here, make Schwarzenegger look good! Very embarrassing execution, disastrously inept special effects and daft performances may you think \"Oh no. There goes another one of my brain cells\" when watching this one-of-a-kind piece of trash. The stuffy film is amateurishly put together with a clichéd narrative that\\'s shamelessly derivative. Reckless characters act tough and spit out macho dribble with attitude. It\\'s pretty mind numbing to listen to, especially when it goes for meaningful conversations. Streaming through is a husky voice-over and a lot white rabbits to hold your attention. Yeah, there\\'s something engaging about those white fluffy rabbits!<br /><br />Despite finding it quite an irritable and drab viewing, few things hit the mark. There are some quite nasty moments when the rubbery alien decides it\\'s torture time with some blood squirting. The thunderous music score manages a few chilling cues. While the performances are laughably hopeless, but Robert Culp and a slightly amusing Andrew Divoff are the odd exception. While, the make-up effects of the outer space visitor are questionable, it still manages to hold up for its tiny budget.<br /><br />Director Harry Bromley (who also directed the first two flicks) is really clutching at straws with this flatly handled and too practical project. Imaginative details, gripping suspense and bug-eyed visuals are long gone here. No techniques really stand out in this by the numbers exercise and what he comes up with is mostly ridiculous and ineffective.<br /><br />Poorly done garbage that turns into a wearisome puddle.',\n",

The \"Bad Guy\" character is pretty much your standard villain who has a shallow disposition and crummy dialog, the same goes for the rest of the \"marines\". If our troop really were to act as they did in this film; then we would all be doomed.

No idea what Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster) is doing here, the rest of the unknown cast if unconvincing.

       " \"First-off, the only reason I'm writing this is because the 4.3 rating is almost impossible. I mean the direction and cinematography by itself will get this movie to a 6. No, I haven't read the book and I genuinely do not believe that the movie should be rated as per the adaptation from the book. The performances standing out are Melissa (of course) and her grandmother. The music and cinematography have a presence of their own throughout the movie. And the plot never gets boring or unrealistic, given a slightly open imagination. If you're aged anywhere between 15 and 35 I would highly recommend a viewing. The only reason I gave it an 8/10 is because we have movies like Fight Club and Animatrix.\",\n",
       " \"At first glance, it was a little bit disappointment, when I saw Melissa P. I had an expectation that Melissa P. herself would have played in this movie. But Maria Valverde was really fitted in the role either with appearance or with talent. In spite of the movie has been showed with the sign 18 circle, when we look at the scenes in reality it deserves a sign 15 circle. There was an incompatibility with the books itself and the movie. Some parts had failed to hit, some parts have been drawn into the scenes fast and verbally. That makes the story snapped. Maybe because of the movie depends on a memoir not on a complete scenario. It seemed that at the end of the movie Melissa had commit a suicide. Then, she appeared on surface and visited her father's mother Nonna Elvira's grave with her mother. It was a misty scenario, not open as we understood. As if Melissa quit these kinds of sex games and correct her communication with her mother forever when she realized she was in wrong way. It is not easy to find a right way after diving too deep. In the book Melissa did not stop playing games.\",\n",
       " \"I saw very little of the book in this film, this is not to say that this alone makes for a poor movie. As a matter of fact it was better that the book despite the fact that I still thought it was awful. I personally feel that the only reason any one bothered to make this book into a film was because of the shock value. Melissa's sexual exploits were for the most part disgusting and whatever was left over was disturbing. I'm not prude but that book nauseated me, and the movie wasn't much better. At least the movie had some kind of a story. The book was more or less a detailed list of all the raunchy things she had done in her past, there was no connection between her and any part of her family. No mention of the grandmother that figures quite largely into the movie's plot, not a peep. All in all if you have the choice between the movie or the book pick the movie, at least it is shorter.\",\n",

There was also unnecessary sexual innuendo of a minor that was not vital to the plot and that is just wrong. I think this film is a sorry excuse for child porn and questions must be raised at the director's choice of cuts and the need for some of the sexual scenes that were not vital to the plot.<br /><br />Other issues: the plot was not that good and the camera work was unnecessarily shaky.<br /><br />The one plus point is that I could see the actress who player Melissa doing a lot more and a lot better in the future but if she continues with this kind of film she will tarnish her reputation for future non-porn films.\",\n",

The Enterprise-D crew\\'s dilemma in this episode is that there is a warp propulsion specialist by the name of Kozynski who won\\'t admit to the crew even the simplest details in how he can make the warp engines traverse great distances across the known galaxy (Almost infinitely instantaneous and faster than warp speed!).<br /><br />In this episode, Wesley Crusher is discovered to be more than just a mere prodigy who has the potential for a bright future due to his gifted abilities - according to The Traveler. This episode also shows glimpses of Tasha\\'s violent past on Turkana IV, and even an illusion of Jean-Luc Picard\\'s deceased mother Yvette.

When the Enterprise engines undergo tests by a warp field specialist Kosinski, his assistant, a being known only as the Traveler from Tau Alpha C, is inadvertently responsible for hurtling the ship across the other side of the galaxy. when a return is attempted they are pushed even further beyond into what can only be described as another place or time beyond what we know as space. In this realm thoughts become reality and we get a tantalizing look into Tasha's troubled past on Turkana 4, a pet targ owned by Worf and even a brief glimpse at several crew members fantasies becoming reality. The budget must have been huge for this episode! We also see Picard's dead mother for a moment in a touching scene too. This was an incredibly impressive episode for such a young show! When they realize the Traveler was responsible they unite to help the Traveler through good thoughts and feelings and the Enterprise is returned home. Picard does the proper thing and gives Wesley a commission to Acting Ensign for his help with the Traveler. Interestingly, the Traveler had earlier discussed with Picard Wesley's future would be an interesting one leaving the viewer to wonder what would become of this throughout the rest of the series run...\",\n",
       " '\"Where No One Has Gone Before\" (Episode 5, Season 1, Air Date 10/26/87, Stardate 41263.1) engages us in a fantastic journey across the universe and beyond, plus it ponders metaphysical questions of the basis of reality and introduces a new power source -- thought power. Near the end of the episode the characters wonder whether the events were like magic or like a sleigh ride! The episode is memorable and thought provoking, but it mixes a few exotic ideas to make a unique story-brew.<br /><br />The Enterprise takes on a propulsion expert, Kosinski (and his assistant), who has a record for dramatically improving efficiencies. Riker, Data, and the chief engineer believe Kosinski is a fraud (they tried his calculations in advance and found no improvement). Deanna Troi adds early mystery since she senses nothing from Kosinski\\'s assistant as if he is like empty space. We later learn that the assistant is an alien life form, trading his knowledge for transportation on starships to observe humans. He is called the Traveler and has the ability to travel through space-time (and deeply understand propulsion, energy, and technology). We learn that Wesley Crusher could also have these capacities in time.<br /><br />The Traveler finds Wesley fascinating since he sees the signs of Traveler type abilities and knowledge in him. During propulsion testing, the Traveler phases in and out of \\'our\\' time or reality and loses control of his powers while looking at Wesley (lost in thought), setting off an accidental burst of speed. The ship hurls across the universe past warp 10 and off our scales of measurement (going 2.7 million miles to M-33).<br /><br />Kosinski is extremely self confident and conceited. He assures Picard he will just do what he did before to take the Enterprise back. If he can\\'t, then it would take them more than their lifetimes to get back to where they started. But Kosinski is mostly a sham and only his assistant can get them back home. The Traveler tries to get them home, but he is so tired he loses control again and propels the Enterprise to \\'where no one has gone before\\', at least, where no human has gone before. The essence of the new place is thought, so some thoughts a person thinks, can become reality. Wow, what an interesting place! If I could go there, I would create elephants that fly and unicorns that shoot ectoplasm out of their horns! I like the graphics of this odd new dimension or reality (that the Traveler takes them on the second burst of speed).<br /><br />I\\'ll leave the rest of the plot alone to avoid major spoilers, but the episode includes several other ideas I enjoyed:<br /><br />(1) Wesley and the Traveler discuss the possibility that space-time and thought \\'aren\\'t the separate things they appear to be\\'. The Traveler asserts that thought is the basis of all reality, that it acts as a propulsive energy, and that knowledge of time, propulsion, and technology gives the Traveler (or Wesley in the future) power to travel to other realities, such as the thought dimension. These are perhaps dangerous thoughts since thoughts have power and our clumsy human minds are not ready to use such power. Like Yoda, the Traveler says we must learn control first.<br /><br />(2) I like the idea of needing to learn to control our thoughts. It would be interesting if the writers had applied these powers to Data. Data would have more control over his thoughts, unless his neural net is as messy as a human mind. Perhaps humans could control our thoughts better with the help of technology, but it doesn\\'t seem likely we could control them better just by thinking really hard. We would need to evolve better mental faculties first.<br /><br />(3) One other of the Traveler\\'s ideas has philosophical parallels to panpsychism though, which is the idea that intelligence exists all through nature. David Chalmers even argues that consciousness should be considered a basic property of physics akin to space-time (\\'The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory\\'). Galen Strawson argues that panpsychism follows from scientific premises (\\'Consciousness and Its Place in Nature: Does Physicalism Entail Panpsychism?\\'). These are not popular views, but popularity doesn\\'t entail truth.<br /><br />(4) However, panpsychism doesn\\'t usually involve the idea that our thoughts can propel us through space-time, nor magically help a genius understand propulsion and technology. In fact, most contemporary physicists tend to avoid the old Einsteinian way of doing physics with thought experiments and thinking by himself (\\'The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality\\'). And no one has good reason to believe in a thought dimension or thought power. So this idea seems more like magic: train your mind and you will gain power over space, time, and acceleration!<br /><br />(5) Is Picard\\'s mother a projected memory or a memory embedded in reality? Or is she just Picard\\'s version of her? Is she really \\'always with him\\'? I thought of the movie \\'Solaris\\' here.<br /><br />(6) The Traveler uses and focuses other human thoughts to intensify his power.<br /><br />(7) Humans have not been interesting enough to warrant investigation from a Traveler until recently.<br /><br />(8) Wesley becomes an acting ensign to set him on the Traveler path.<br /><br />(9) Excitement for scientific discovery runs high (new proto-stars are forming, new thought worlds exist right outside), but safety and getting home takes precedence.<br /><br />Some later episodes bring back the Traveler (\\'Journey\\'s End\\') and panpsychism (such as in \\'Haven\\').<br /><br />Panpsychism and thought powers aren\\'t clearly stated in the episode and seem more like a sleigh ride as Geordi suggests. Maybe it\\'s Star Trek\\'s way of getting around the illegitimacy of ESP in today\\'s scientific world. But this episode was so fantastical, and mixed enough with scientific excitement for new discoveries, that it solidly held my interest.',\n",
       " \"A very beautiful film by master Ingmar Bergman. Four women, all sisters-in-law, await their husbands in a house on an island. They converse, and soon begin to tell each other the big stories of their lives. The first tells how she had an affair with her teenage sweetheart and how her husband reacts. The second tells of how she was seduced and became pregnant. And the third tells about how she once got her husband to admit his philandering when they were stuck in an elevator. Meanwhile, in the framing episode, a younger sister of one of the women has fallen in love with the fourth brother. The first and third stories are a little cliched, especially the elevator sequence, but they're still quite great. Being trapped in an elevator is a nice, easy, and overused way for two characters to solve problems, but the dialogue between Gunnar Bjornstrand and Eva Dahlbeck is so excellent that it works out wondefully. The heart of the film is in the second story. It's so simple and well-done, so utterly beautiful in its conception and execution. It is, of course, a flashback, like the other two stories, but the story itself is also told in flashbacks. It works far better than I would have ever guessed. Secrets of Women is an underrated Bergman film, a must-see for any fan. 9/10.\",\n",
       " \"I love this movie; although not amongst Bergman's best, it is very funny in parts and should not be shunned. Maybe slightly overlong - each time I watch it I wait impatiently for the lift-scene near the end of the film - but very much worthwhile. Indeed, the scene in the lift with Gunnar Bjornstrand (great actor) and Eva Dahlberg is fascinating, funny and frivolous - for the year it was made.\",\n",
       " \"While this movie was not exactly earth-shaking, it was a well-made film that held my attention. It's about 4 lady friends who are waiting for their husbands to meet them at their summer retreat. While waiting, they begin to tell their innermost secrets about their marriages--particularly the details of boredom or infidelity. The most memorable one of these is the final segment with the husband and wife stuck in the elevator, though they all were well acted and interesting. Those who are great fans of the later depressing work of Bergman may find this movie a bit of a letdown, it should appeal to those in the audience who want greater depth in the plot without the hopelessness that accompanies many later Bergman films.\",\n",
       " 'Early Bergman, and from the onset it is clear an artist is at work. The first conversation piece, with all 5 waiting women in the same room, is a long shot approaching 4 minutes, with various of the women talking. There are also already some typical Bergman postures, with one woman talking intensely and the one next to her staring vapidly past her downwards, seemingly lost in her own inner world. All that in well and good, but as soon as I heard the first monotonous monologue from the mother, her eyes turning to heaven, speaking of how she can not reach out to her husband\", not even to scratch his eyes out, my Bergman-radar immediately hit the red zone. And surely enough, we are in for group therapy all the way, as each woman tells of one significant episode from their lives with their husbands. But it is a very elegant movie, and along the way you become quite sympathetic, even though all the stories describe infidelity and frigid bourgeous lives. My eye was caught by Eva Dahlbeck, who I also recently saw in Sommarnöje sökes. Here, at 32, she is sizzlingly hot. Overall it is a movie not to be missed by Bergman lovers, if mainly for historical reasons. His next movie was Monika, so this one can be said to commence his golden period. For the trivia-consumers: IMDb informs that Eva Dahlbeck has recently filed for divorce, after, ahem, 67 years of marriage. You go, girl!',\n",
       " \"See it. Lyrical, beautifully shot, quietly hilarious in spots, this film is seldom screened. Perhaps more than his better-known works, this film showcases Bergman's love of women. Bjork, Dahlbeck and especially Nilsson are adoringly photographed; this is passionate young Bergman. A delight.\",\n",
       " \"This movie was made and distributed by the Mormon Church. But, unlike most films that fall into the above category, this movie is not about religion, missionary work, joining any church, etc. and so forth. This short film could have quite possibly been made by anyone. That is what makes it so good. It is a story about a trader coming to one of the small islands of the world to get himself a wife. The island is so small, there is only room enough for one village. There are none of the modern conveniences of the rest of the world, and everything is either built by the villagers or acquired by traders who visit the island by boat and trade for their handmade goods. In this village, it is custom to bargain and pay the father of the bride in dairy cows. This may sound like a serious film, but it really is rather quite funny and has some real classic lines to it that I'm sure will endear you to the film. The story is simple yet original and the flow and pacing for the film is perfect. If you can pick it up, it would be worth the effort.\",\n",

Though made for any type of regular viewing, other than religious, its purpose was just a teaching tool to show value in every person and that there is beauty in everything. And sometimes it takes a little encouragement to show others the beauty.<br /><br />Set in the early 1900's on an island in Polynesia, the film starts out with a local trader who barters for a wife. The father of the young girl is surprised why anyone would want his daughter as she is not the islands prized beauty. The father, thinking he can barely get 1 cow for his daughter tries to start high and haggle down low to gain his own respect. The trader comes up with an outrageous high number of cows and shocks the town when he arrives with all healthy and the full number of cows he promised.<br /><br />This is truly an inspiration to ones self esteem, showing that worth and beauty is always in the beholder. Excellent to have in any collection.\",\n",

Racist, sexist, imperialistic--c'mon, get a life! The little 'slave' boy, grinning lackey slacker? Who just won't work reliably for the white trader? The idea that women's worth is to be measured on the basis of her looks (though admitting we can sometimes be wrong about it)???? That men set the value of all things, including women? <br /><br />This is truly as bad as it gets. Too bad Mormon children --especially the girls-- have to grow up with this crap.\",\n",
       " \"Of course the story of Johnny Lingo is one of the classics for Mormon children; the message it conveys is true and probably much more important today than it was at the time it was made. What makes it really watchable though, are the performances. Not their quality, but on the contrary, the lack thereof. The acting is so stiff and inept that You will laugh tears. I don't think, that Johnny Lingo was intented as funny as it comes out, but it is always worth watching. Beside trying to convey the message, that beauty is relative, inner beauty is that counts and that every one needs someone to believe in him to reach his full potential, there is no reference to the Mormon church or Mormon beliefs at all.\",\n",

C-3PO and R2-D2 make a special appearance in the line, arguing as usual. Now the ride. You're a passenger on a StarSpeeder which is taking you to Endor. Your pilot, Rex, is a first-time pilot and messes up by taking the wrong turn. You fly through a hanger and, after much confusion, leave. You enter hyperspace, but fly past Endor. Great. You end up flying through a comet, breaking through ice. You exit the comet and what do know! Star Destroyers. You end up being a part of the battle that's going on between the Rebellion and the Empire. You go through the Death Star trench scene(except Luke is NOT blowing up the Death Star). You finally make it to a Star Tours station, but not without almost crashing. You then leave and get to a souvenirs shop. They have anything you can think of there. Now Star Tours is a little outdated. But it's still enjoyable. When I first went on it I was 8, hated Star Wars, and loved the ride. That's how fun it is.

All and all this is a decent ride but as many star wars fans will know, there are some major flaws in this ride: <br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />1. As this is taking place after the battle of Endor, how can there be another Death star that is completely built up like the first one, when the second one was no where near completion? 2.

It's so cool to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up close! You feel like those who have been in the movies. Then you board the ship. Your captain: RX Droid named Rex. The start of the flight is bumpy because he steers the ship right into the maintenence bay, then he zooms right past the Endor moon and right into a comet field. When that has passed, we run into the Empire! Then we help the rebellion blow the Death Star into oblivion then arrive safely at our destination.<br /><br /> Again, the coolest ride at Disneyland!

A breathe of fresh air in the horror films which is recreating itself once again as a truly important genre. Both of these films are good, and borderline great. they take somewhat sillacious storylines and make them somewhat believable filled with aggreassive dark humor and independent film dread. This sequel is pretty much a direct continuation of the original. It leaves the last films heroine Bridget infected and fighting her illness with the cure found in the last film. She's beginning to change when she's taken in by a youth facility and locked up for drug abuse. What insues is unfortunatly unwelcome and senseless visits from the first films title charachter but a vast mixing pool of other cringe inducing twists including the fact that a male werewolf has found her and wants to mate. A sleezy hospital guard who trades sexual favors for drugs. An innocent little girl obsessed with comic books. I wish I could truly give away the ending to you. Because it was so well done and I just didnt see it coming. And that is what this film prides itself on unpredictability. It goes in a completely opposite direction of where you though it was going and it makes sense. All in all the film has much to be successful with believable performances, especially from the film's lead Bridget, a good storyline, suspenseful direction, a creepy score all adding up to a startling refreshing take on an otherwise dying genre.

       " \"This is an enjoyable and surprisingly competent DTV follow up to cult hit Ginger Snaps. The first film was dark, entertaining and witty and had a good amount of tension and scares. The sequel is good fun but lacks the wit of the original and a certain amount of the hip-ness. The lack of Ginger herself is also evident. Katherine Isabelle is back but essentially in a cameo as the ghost of Ginger while once again the angst ridden sister Bridget is the centre of the story. Following the events of the first film, Bridget is on the run, moving from town to town and constantly taking monkshood (the drug that prevents werewolfism) to stop her turning into a werewolf following the final confrontation in the first film. When she is found overdosing on the stuff she falls into a coma and wakes up in a mental hospital but soon she is tracked down by another werewolf and with no monkshood to slow down her own transformation she must fight her impending hairiness. As she has found, Monkshood doesn't prevent Wolfiness, only slows the transformation. At the institute she meets the eccentric Ghost, who is fascinated with Bridget and soon learns of her problem. When a residents of the institute start turning up dead Ghost initially suspects Bridget but they soon discover that a mate is tracking Bridget to make hairy werewolf babies with her. As well as this Ghost may not be quite as she seems. This is well shot and has some tense moments and considering its small budget it is a remarkably accomplished and enjoyable piece of work. A good and more low key Ginger Snaps movie it is. ***\",\n",
       " \"Brigitte now has the virus in her blood that destroyed her sister Ginger in the first film. So to prevent herself from changing into the beast she injects monksblood into her system, but after an overdose she wakes up in a rehabilitation clinic. Which now she has become so attached to the syrup and without it, the affects of the curse starts to transform within her. From the physical to the mental attributes. But also on her tail is that of a male werewolf who wants to mate with her and Ginger is keeping a tab on her by haunting her mind. <br /><br />I remember when I picked up 'Ginger Snaps' I was expecting another mediocre or below-average werewolf flick. Gosh, I was wrong! Just like 'Dog Soldiers' it was more then good and added some new life to the whimpering sub-genre. And I'm happy to say it worked out again in this monstrous sequel and I was actually digging this one a tad more, though that was up until the stalling sequences involving hiding out in a house. It would've been great to see more Katharine Isabelle as Ginger too, but you can't have it all your own way I guess. I wasn't expecting anything incredibly special, but it did have big boots to fill and we all know the law of diminishing returns. Well, this sequel keeps far away form that trend and doesn't lean away from the quirky and offbeat nature of its predecessor, but it actually enhances it with a very morbid and cold-hearted appeal. It's depressing to the bone, I but I get kick out of any films that create this sort of tone! Though what made the original rejuvenating was that it had warm and natural relationships between the characters, especially between Bridget and Ginger, but also with the parents. Because of the sequel's depressing vibe, it does lack the heartache of the horrifying matter that drove the sisters even closer in the first film. Also it sorely does miss the characteristic interactions between the sisters. Although saying that they do share some screen time here, but only in small doses meaning far less impact. <br /><br />The plot is an absorbing one, which doesn't break a whole lot of new ground like the original, but still comes up with enough hunger to set it out from most other horror flicks of the last decade, but also adding another dimension to the tale. Just like in the first film and like many reviewers have painted it's a metaphor for adolescent life, from angst, drugs and sex. But this cocktail is mixed with a refreshing twist involving the werewolf mythology, introducing the metaphor part of all of this. The snappy script holds up well and the story moves along pretty quickly with enough excitement initiated and the twists are far from easy to detect. No way is this story's structure predictable! The actual ending was kind of clever, but felt odd and left me feeling a little unsatisfied. The editing was swiftly sharp and potent to the pacing. It also recaptures the slickly handled production of that of the original, but it looks like it had more to work with here. That's especially because the special effects and werewolf designs were vastly better this time around and the attacks were more callous and bloodier. The isolated setting was made to great use with its cold wintry backdrop and gloomy awe. The action might have up the ante in this sequel, but so did the soundtrack by igniting itself with the Gothic and haunting tunes that made the original great. The upbeat tempo of the soundtrack bounds the mood. The spectral sound effects also worked its way into the picture and it was hard to shut out its thumping vibration throughout. The out-and-out stylistic camera-work sinuously develops some inventive shots. The direction by Brett Sullivan is above par and he hones down his skills with preciseness but adding such tautness and tension to the picture. The performances were magnificent. Emily Perkins comes out of the shadow of Katharine Isabelle here, and she made the most of it by turning in a convincing performance. Tatiana Maslany as Ghost one of the kids in the clinic provides on the humour side of things and Eric Johnson is perfectly scummy as one of the workers at the clinic. Katharine Isabelle makes some small but yet effective glimpses and adds in with some voice-overs. This production most definitely went one step bigger.<br /><br />After two worthy werewolf films, I wonder if the film makers can repeat this winning formula in their third flick of the series Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning (2004) or will it come crashing back to earth with a thud. The sequel is very much on par with the original and definitely well worth the look. Actually I would say it's a must-see if you seen the original.\",\n",
       " 'Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed. * * 1/2 Actors: Emily Perkins, Tatiana Maslany, Eric Johnson Writer: Megan Martin Director: Brett Sullivan.<br /><br />The second part of the \"Ginger Snaps\" trilogy picks up after the first one. Bridgitte has infected herself with Ginger\\'s blood who has turned into a werewolf. In order to keep herself from becoming like her sister, she must inject herself daily with monkshood. After barely escaping a werewolf that has found her, she awakes in a clinic that treats all things including drug addiction. With her drugs taken away, Bridgitte can\\'t escape what she is becoming.<br /><br />I loved the 1st movie and I found the second one to be a worthwhile sequel. While the first one simmered with satire on female hormones and puberty, \"Unleashed\" is a straight horror film. It\\'s too bad we don\\'t see much of Ginger in this one, but she does turn up as a ghost who warns Bridgitte that another one waits for her. Bridgitte is a lot more confident and a lot hotter than the first one. But although this is her story, the one character that steals the show is a young girl at the hospital named Ghost. Bridgitte befriends this girl because she can help get her monkshood and I\\'m sure she feels a little bad that all the other patients make fun of her. There is a twist at the end of this movie that I was not expecting, but on my second viewing of it. I don\\'t know how I could have missed it. All the warning signs were shown in the first thirty minutes.<br /><br />If you haven\\'t seen the first one you could just watch this one alone. It has a good enough story to keep you interested. It\\'s not as fulfilling as the original, but it\\'s a nice desert',\n",
       " \"I liked it a lot, in fact even more than the first movie. I loved the character of Ghost and all the comic book shots and her third person lines. Good ending. One thing they could have done was make the identity of the werewolf clearer. Also when the sister appeared it was kind of forced.. it didn't seem like she was a delusion\",\n",
       " \"This is the only sequel I have seen that could be considered an improvement on its original.<br /><br />I'm a great Fan of Ginger Snaps and was really excited about this film when i first heard about it, unfortunately when it arrived at the cinema I was to young to see it. I'm sure its always a gamble for people and film fans alike to buy movies on Tapoe/DVD with out viewing them first and for me this was a first. It was well worth the risk of my cash as I loved the film, the casting was especially good this time around ( the DVD showing the auditions in all their glory ) As far as the films go Emily Perkins takes her original part and runs with it, totally convincing the audience that she is trying to break away from her sister and the ghosts of the past.<br /><br />The special effects and make up are of course grander this time around which enhances the horror side of things, but I my self view this more as a Drama that a Horror film. The suspense is really edgy and makes you want to fast forward to the next scene to see what happens next. As well as the stand allow story of Briditte's new company 'Ghost' making you want more as the plot continues. Even as a sequel this is a hard one to beat. I whole heartedly will you to see it, even if you have not yet view the first one.\",\n",
       " '\"Ginger Snaps:Unleashed\" is a pretty smart sequel to my beloved werewolf horror \"Ginger Snaps\".Brigitte is an addict.After mixing blood with her sister Ginger she has been infected with the virus.Each day the curse grows stronger and she must increase her dosage of injections.When she is found lying face down in the snow after the near escape from another beast,she is thrown into drug rehabilitation-locked behind the doors without her life-saving antidote.\"Ginger Snaps:Unleashed\" is almost as good as the first one.The soundtrack is awesome and creates a creepy atmosphere of desperation and isolation.There is plenty of gore and violence and some really vicious werewolf attacks.The acting is excellent with outstanding performance by Emily Perkins.The film is really tense,so if you liked the original you won\\'t be disappointed.Highly recommended.',\n",
       " '\"Ginger Snaps\" single-handedly raised my interest in lycanthropic cinema, and \"Ginger Snaps Unleashed\" is a remarkably strong sequel that works for many of the same reasons. Like the thoughtful horror cinema of George Romero, where deeper human issues boil under a more obvious horror surface, \"Ginger Snaps\" used lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty and its impact on teenage relationships; \"Unleashed\" uses it as a metaphor for addiction, with Brigitte Fitzgerald (Emily Perkins--\"It\"), sister of the ill-fated Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), injecting herself with wolfbane to curb her increasingly wolf-like tendencies. While in a rehab clinic for troubled teens, Brigitte forges a relationship with Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), a precocious girl whose seeming innocence unravels her secret. The new writing/directing team of Megan Martin and Brett Sullivan pick up where the previous film left off, skillfully bridging the two with a bare minimum of rehashed exposition, and the end result is extremely satisfying (though the machinations of \"Unleashed\"\\'s final third made me wish the script had tied some thematic/character arcs together better). Perkins, who is becoming a real horror ingénue, plays Brigitte with sympathy and sarcastic bite, and her relationship with Maslany comes close to matching the sense of sisterly love that provided the endearing backbone of the original \"Ginger Snaps.\" \"Unleashed\" is the rare sequel that does its parent proud.',\n",
       " 'Brigitte (Emily Perkins) is alone, after killing her sister Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), and injecting a substance called monkshood to delay the process of transformation in a werewolf. She has an overdose and is sent to a rehabilitation clinic, where she is mistakenly taken as a drug addicted. Meanwhile, a beast is chasing her, trying to become mated with her. Ginger escapes from the clinic with Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), a needy and lonely girl that wants to be friend of Brigitte. \"Ginger Snaps: Unleashed\" is a great sequel of \"Ginger Snaps\". The participation of Katharine Isabelle is minimum and basically is limited to give her name to the credits. However, Emily Perkins has another excellent performance in the dramatic role of a young woman fighting against her fate. This sequel is very claustrophobic and also very violent, but it deserved a better conclusion. The story is better than the first one, but I was a little disappointed with the end. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Possuída 2\" (\"Possessed 2\")',\n",
       " 'After the explosively entertaining \"Ginger Snaps\", I had some doubts that the sequels could live up to the original. But in this one, we are greeted to a wonderful film picking up exactly where the first one left off: now with Bridget trying to stop herself from becoming a werewolf, and escaping from the rehab center she has been placed in.<br /><br />If you find cutting and self-mutilation to be disgusting, then this is the film you want to either see or avoid. The opening credits are over a scene of Bridget in the bathtub, cutting herself to pieces. She continues to cut herself throughout the movie, as well as give herself injections.<br /><br />The scenery is fantastic, as rehabs, hospitals and insane asylums are always great places for horror films if you know how to film them. The makers of this film know exactly what they\\'re doing. Add secret passageways and you\\'re set.<br /><br />The new cast is also wonderful, easily making up for Ginger having a very small role. The cast now has several male staffers working in an all-girl rehab center, leading to such activities as trading sexual favors for drugs. But most importantly is a new character named \"Ghost\" (presumably because she\\'s almost like an albino) who is fascinated with the occult and death and befriends Bridget after finding out she might be a werewolf.<br /><br />Some interesting plot twists happen I can\\'t reveal here, and as the wolf blood begins to overtake the human blood, things heat up. And then another werewolf shows up to try and mate.<br /><br />Oh, heck. Just watch the movie. These guys have taken a worn-out horror staple (lycanthropy) and added such a new dimension to it that it\\'s almost like an entirely new invention. Excelsior!',\n",

The entire acting cast fit each of their roles perfectly. I\\'ve seen most of the main actors before, either on TV or on big screen. Tony Shalhoub is perfect as Adrian Monk. Some of you might remember him as Jack Jeebs in \"Men in Black II\". Bitty Schram is classic in the role as the more serious other half of the comedy duo, that being Monk\\'s \"half way house psych nurse\" Sharona Fleming. I loved the scene where they were playing the board game \"Clue\" ... classic anticipatory comedy! I still chuckle thinking about it. If this series were to appear in print I would read them all! I look forward to watching many more episodes of this series. I hope it\\'s temporary absence from the small screen doesn\\'t mean that it hasn\\'t made the ratings cut!',\n",
       " 'Initially Monk had endings that were really mismatched or less politely dumb. We would watch a great show and then boom, stupid ending. But recently the endings are much more creative and actually push this fun show beyond a 10. Simply great, clean, and fun entertainment..',\n",
       " \"This is great television. Fun, well acted, great plots and not so serious. I loved the fat man episode. Please, please, please don't let this one go away. I just smile the whole time Monk is obsessing his way to the inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />\",\n",

       " \"Monk is a great detective show that you can sometimes solve along with Monk if you are a genius. The show is entertaining and despite what most people say, Monk's obsessive compulsive disorders are so funny! Not annoying! The commercials are sometimes long, but not often. For any person who even lightly likes mysteries, this show is for you.\",\n",
       " '\"Monk\" is a decent new TV show. The title character is a former police detective who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). At first I was worried that the show would milk his OCD too much for humor value and make it a mean spirited run-on joke, or that it would become too sappy with fawning sympathy for him. Thankfully, the show\\'s writers and director have found a good middle path combining human dignity with enough humorous situations to keep it fresh and upbeat. The characters are fairly good, with two exceptions: the police chief\\'s assistant and the weekly villains. The assistant is one-dimensional as a dunce. He\\'s the sort of character who\\'s funny once but unbelievable and annoying as a regular role. The weekly villains often engage too much in chewing the scenery. It\\'s like watching Scooby Doo, where at the end the apprehended bad guy always sneers, \"And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren\\'t for this crazy guy and his sexy nurse!\"<br /><br />The aspect of the show that\\'s weakest in my opinion is its believability as a police procedural. Yes, I know this is character drama and not another spinoff from the Law & Order franchise, but I did see an interview with the show\\'s creator where he said that one of the main goals of this show is to function as a clue-finding whodunnit, much like a Sherlock Holmes story. In that respect I have difficulty believing Monk\\'s abilities. His astute eye for detail, I\\'ll accept as a combination of him being a smart guy, a trained detective, and an OCD sufferer. But his encyclopedic knowledge of seemingly every topic that comes up in the course of evaluating evidence, I can\\'t swallow. In addition, that preternatural genius removes some of the plot buildup. There\\'s no increasing tension as Monk puts in legwork or research time figuring things out; he just has to see all the clues and, Bam!, he\\'s got the answer.<br /><br />On the whole, Monk is a good show. It\\'s definitely above average for network and cable TV series. But I\\'m a very picky viewer (I currently watch about 5 hours/week), and after watching several episodes I find the show\\'s shortfalls put it right at the borderline between what I think is worth watching and what is not.',\n",
       " \"It was a good show idea and very funny. But I didn't feel that suspense feeling I was hoping to get. The commercials are too long and ill placed. It takes away from the show if you can mop the kitchen floor during breaks. But the show is a good idea and has humor which is something series like Law and Order don't have as much as. So for its lack or suspense it makes up for in humor and uniqueness.\",\n",
       " \"I love this show. You feel a bit sorry for Monk's obsessive compulsiveness and yet have to laugh at his good fortune because of it. I love his ability to see clues that nobody else can. The writing is fabulous. I am definitely putting this show on my must see list.\",\n",
       " 'I was really looking forward to this show, and all in all it was OK. The plot was fine, the acting was good, etc. Monk\\'s obsessive behavior, which was supposed to be quirky, got to be more annoying than quirky, but it\\'s something that they can work on. But they\\'ll work on it for someone other than me. Why? Because the damn commercial breaks went on FOREVER!!! They had to be 5 or 6 minutes long each. I saw more spots for \"The Dead Zone\", Bowflex and acid reflux than I can count. I was caught up in the plot, so I didn\\'t want to change channels, but never again. I suppose I could record the show and skip the commercials, but that ain\\'t the point.',\n",

I know that we\\'re all in total disbelief and are feeling furious and outraged since head writer, Hogan Sheffer, killed off John Black...speaking for myself, I never believed that DAYS would go through with this travesty and would actually fire Drake, but sadly, we can\\'t undo something that has already been done. All we can do is move forward and show Drake\\'s bosses that we will not rest until we are victorious and Drake is back on DAYS where he belongs.<br /><br />We\\'d also like to take this opportunity to clear up some rumors. First off, Drake did NOT leave DAYS on his own because he was unhappy on the show or because he wished to retire...simply put, Drake was fired! I know that many people don\\'t want to accept this fact, but it was confirmed by Drake\\'s Fan Club President, so it is no longer deniable. Drake is also quoted in Soap Opera Digest and Soap Opera Weekly as saying that he learned of his character\\'s demise from Executive Producer Ken Corday. \"He called me at home, that\\'s usually not a good thing. Whenever there are changes in head writing or producing, other changes are imminent. I wasn\\'t shocked by the news.\" His leading lady, Deidre Hall, said that \"Drake came into work one day and he confided that Ken had told him that it was bad news and they weren\\'t going in his direction, so they were going to kill the character.\" Drake also talks about sleep deprivation since he found out that he is being forced to leave the show and how \"It has been an incredibly difficult several weeks due to the disbelief, shock and then final acceptance and closure which is inevitable in any creative endeavor.\" So bottom line is that this man was fired, and I don\\'t know about anybody else, but I\\'m not about to take Drake\\'s sentence lying down!

We\\'ll be opening up this type of thread on as many DAYS message boards as we can, and in December we\\'ll be printing out the lists, putting them in a binder, book-style format and sending it to TPTB. We\\'re going to see if we can get a small group to go down to NBC studios and present the book to either Ken Corday or Edward Scott\\'s assistant, so that we know for a fact that it will be seen. Since I post at very few DAYS boards (I only post here at Soap City and at the DAYS NBC board), I would REALLY appreciate it if many Drake fans from here could take this text and start a thread about this campaign on one of the message boards that you all frequent.

We love Frances Reid as the beloved matriarch Alice Horton. Deirdre Hall still looks great in her 50s. You could dress her in rags and she'll still look great. The cast has featured long term actors and actresses in roles we love. We love these couples too. Of course, you can't take anything on this show seriously but that's because we already take life too seriously. The show has one of the strongest fan bases around. If you want to argue, just go look at the results of the Soap Opera Digest Awards. Days has swept those award ceremonies for years. Who cares if the story lines are ridiculous like Marlena's possession and that she was the secret killer of so many beloved characters on the show. Ironically, they all went to a secret island somewhere like Lost long before that show came on the air. I was just happy that they were alive somewhere that I didn't care about the logic of it. We wanted them to be alive living somewhere. The show will never be the classic like Young and the Restless has been over the years. If you want fun, you will watch Days of Our Lives because regardless of the show's story lines which are outrageous, the cast pulls it off better than any ensemble around. NBC, if you are reading, soaps are a part of the American culture and should be around forever.\",\n",
       " \"Days Of Our Lives is by far my favorite show, it takes you away from reality and into a world so different or perhaps in some aspects the same and show's you different sides of it. Some story lines may be a little out their like the Salem stalker but most story lines have meaning to them like the Dimera/Brady feud to show real meaning of hatred. Even though sometimes the same storyline can drag on and on and yes it is a bit annoying but it makes you keep on watching and sometimes sitting on the edge of your seat. Days of our lives is something that was not made in one day all episode's of days in my opinion must take hard work and I find every single actor and actress is amazing. Days of our lives get a 10 in my opinion for amazing acting; creative story lines & amazing connections with are world and a different world. If you don't watch Day Of Our Lives I suggest you start now!\",\n",

The only time people interact with others is to whine about their significant other, or plot to steal someone elses significant other.<br /><br />There is no more warm and loving family or friend interaction for the sake of it, and that is the glue that holds the show together.<br /><br />I\\'m saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.<br /><br />It\\'s not too late for NBC to fix this, but I\\'m guessing these pleas will fall on deaf ears.',\n",
       " \"I have been watching Days of Our Lives for 11 years and am still a HUGE fan. I have found there to be at least one good storyline at all times on the show even if there are a couple other ones that are slightly on the boring side. For the most part, the acting is well done and isn't as cheesy as some of the other soap operas I occasionally watch (minus Deidre Hall who is REALLY breathy and over-the-top with her acting at times). Some of the story lines are truly memorable and stick with you for years (for example, Sami on trial for Franco's murder). I will admit that when I first started watching it, there seemed to be more romance with the main couples (Bo and Hope, John and Marlena) and that some of the story lines in recent years have really affected these relationships. Nevertheless, this soap opera still offers romance and a variety of story lines that cater to the genre interests of television fans. It delivers high-quality entertainment for soap opera fans and luckily has many of the original actors that people have come to know and love (Alison Sweeney you are still my personal favorite). If you are looking for a new soap opera to fill your daytime television schedule, Days of Our Lives is a great choice to consider.\",\n",
       " \"It may soon be over but I have some good memories of Days during the years. Belle helping her friend Chloe from her shell was one of the quality moments of DOOL. The silly charm of studio exteriors, arteficial dialogue, Marlena's possession and wonderful Salem Stalker were and are a quality camp. I enjoyed Celeste's premonitions and I liked genetically manipulated Gemini twins - I especially loved psychotic Rex! I can't understand the lure and redemption of Ej - Why to make him a hero? Because he is not fat or balding or geeky-looking? Because he is filth? - but there has been lot of good stuff after overrated 1980s.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve watched the show on/off since the 1980\\'s. I was initially drawn to the characters, especially Jennifer who I identified with. I stopped watching the first time the show got ultra religious and had Marlena possessed and John turn out to be a priest. A few years ago I found out they brought back Matthew Ashford to play Jack, so I started watching again. I had to stop again very quickly when they gave MEDICALLY INACCURATE information about abortions and tried to demonize the choice to not carry a fetus to term. Occasionally I\\'ll sneak a peak (when they brought back Frankie) but I am unable to watch more than a few minutes before I get disgusted/angry.<br /><br />Literally, every other sentence is a reference to god/religion. (specifically Christianity). Seriously, try making a list of the number of times per episode someone goes to the hospital chapel (with a big cross), goes to St. Luke\\'s church or says a prayer or if you really want some fun, keep track of the # of times someone references \"god\", \"prayer\", \"miracle\" or a priest. Weddings now feature passages from the bible, sermons and morality lectures from the Irish priest. Christmas now features bible readings. Mimi literally had visions of the Virgin Mary. Nearly every single character blatantly wears a large visible cross (sometimes they have cross necklaces. I don\\'t normally care if there\\'s mentions of religion or god in a show, nor do I normally notice/care if someone wears a cross - but this is BLATANT / IN YOUR FACE pushing of Christianity. (note all the Christian rock ads during the show) It is the main reason I do not watch this show. This proselytizing is offensive and ruins the show!!<br /><br />The second reason I don\\'t watch anymore is how conservative this show is. I could list many examples, but I\\'ll limit myself to a few: Now I have no problem with parents staying home to care for their kids if they want to/can afford it. However, I caught a recent rant to Belle about how women\\'s NUMBER ONE (and implied...SOLE PURPOSE) is to stay home with their children. Mind you, it was not worded as \"parental\" duties - it was definitely very gendered to only the mom. And there is CONTINUOUS bashing of single adults or even nonbiological parents raising children! Belle literally credited her good life solely to the fact that both her biological parents raised her. And others have over and over again stated that children who don\\'t have both biological parents (only heterosexuals of course!) will be screwed up. This is so outdated (and incorrect if you examine developmental psychology studies!) and so antifeminist it angers me. Speaking of incorrect facts, making Mimi not only suffer hallucinations & guilt and being left for having an abortion - they went so far as to claim her abortion made her sterile! This was a blatant antichoice \"lesson\" with no balance perspective or any other viewpoints shown! Marlena/Belle claim doctors & logical reason are wrong - \"faith\" will cure John. This show pushes a conservative social agenda and is probably written by the religious right to push their views about how people should live their lives.<br /><br />The show lacks any relation to actual reality. Outside of maybe the midwest or the south is there really such a homogeneous set of Caucasian middle-upper class people? I can count on one hand the number of times I\\'ve seen Asian or Latin people. And there\\'s only ever 4 African-Americans - the super-stereotype \"Vodoo priestess\" Celeste; Lexie, Abe (and if there\\'s another Af-Am male then you KNOW Lexie will have to sleep with him. ) They flirted with having one gay character but there must\\'ve been a protest or something because he disappeared quickly. And per their ultraChristian missionary bent, there are no other religions even mentioned or god forbid (pun intended) an atheist!<br /><br />The last irksome details to me is how the show has decided that it only wants to appeal to Caucasian Christian conservatives who are country-listening Nascar fans. Nowadays ALL the music at any bar or restaurant or a character is listening to is always country (except when they do a rare unsubtle promotional stunts like Rolling Stones or Smokey Robinson). Recently they\\'ve decided they need to try to appeal even more to the Nascar crowd so they\\'ve brought in 3 racecar drivers and featured a race in an episode. They\\'ve dumbed down Shawn\\'s character - he was in college planning to be a lawyer - now all of a sudden he is shown saying he doesn\\'t know how to use a computer and settles for a blue-collar job fixing cars as the only job he can get? Max (the Nascar racer) & Shawn talk about how they goes HUNTING, Connor\\'s a southern drawlin\\' rodeo cowboy? How much more redneck can they get? Bo actually said \"git er done\" the other day.<br /><br />I love many of the actors/characters (Jack, Jenn, John, Frankie, Patch, Billie, Sami etc.) but I can\\'t stand the writers\\' social agenda. NBC please note: If you ever join the rest of the nation in this century & update their show, we would start watching again. But if they\\'re really going to carry on airing this propaganda piece for the religious right, then I wish they would just cancel the show rather than demean the characters/actors by doing this to them! <br /><br />I\\'m not asking for anything crazy like a John&Abe love match or Hope to catch AIDS from unprotected sex with a guy she barely knows (Patrick). But how about an interracial couple? Or a Jewish character? Or an Asian person (who\\'s not a doctor) Or a non-\"nuclear\" family of mom-dad-kid-- how about a single dad? Let\\'s lose the stereotypes & show a place that acknowledges todays diverse population and ways of living.',\n",
       " \"Ah, yes. I can remember not too long ago. At that time, one thing I would do each weekday was watch this classic soap opera. From that moment on, I was hooked on it. In addition, If you ask me, Marlena (Deidre Hall) really is diabolical. You would have to have seen some of the things she's done if you want to know why. I also enjoyed the days when Eric (Jensen Ackles) was on the show. Ever since he left the show, I haven't watched it as much. You'd have to have seen the show between 1997 and 200 if you want to know why. However, this is still a good soap opera. In conclusion, I highly recommend this classic soap opera to all you die-hard NBC fans.\",\n",

The characters all are different, yet I feel like I can really understand all of their point of views even if they are conflicting. My favorite characters are Kate and Chelsea even though they aren't known as the nicest people at least they they are believable.

That he was considered hopelessly old fashioned by the dawn on talkies is irrelevant. His early short films helped set the tone for the look and feel and attitudes toward Indians, cowboys, the American West, the Civil War, etc. While this film (at 15 minutes) is not dramatically moving, it IS important as an early look at Griffith\\'s love of and attitudes toward history. Even in 1909 he was not afraid of portraying the settlers as \"conquerors\" any more than he was afraid to take an honest look at our Civil War period in THE BIRTH OF A NATION in 1915.',\n",
       " 'Following the release of \\'The Birth of the Nation (1915),\\' director D.W. Griffith has often been branded with the unfortunate attribute of being a racist. While it\\'s difficult to argue with that film\\'s unabashed advocacy of the KKK, it\\'s also interesting to observe a few of Griffith\\'s other films, in which he displays an undeniable sensitivity towards other cultures. Take, for example, \\'Broken Blossoms (1919),\\' where a Chinese immigrant (portrayed, admittedly, by American Richard Barthelmess) is shown to be, by far, the film\\'s most compassionate and respectable male character. \\'The Red Man\\'s View (1909)\\' was one of hundreds of short films that Griffith produced for the Biograph Company from 1908-1913, and it represents a pivotal step in the development of the Western genre. One of the earliest to explore the conflicts between Native Americans and European settlers, the film treats the plight of the Indians with respect and empathy, quietly condemning the actions of the \"conquerers,\" who invaded the land and left countless tribes homeless.<br /><br />Living a comfortable and happy existence in the remote wilderness, a Native American tribe goes about its daily business. A young man, Silver Eagle (Owen Moore), has fallen in love with a beautiful maiden, and it seems that nothing can come between the adoring couple. However, as one might expect, a conflict of cultures is on the horizon. A ragged pack of unkempt settlers emerges over the hill, pistols at their sides, and they arrogantly demand that the Native Americans move from the area. After a brief but fruitless protest, the tribe chooses to avoid a violent confrontation and regretfully departs, but not before the nefarious settlers claim Silver Eagle\\'s young maiden as their own. Torn between the love for his sweetheart, and loyalty towards his dying father, the young man mournfully follows suit. The tribe walks for miles, it seems, but they are unable to find a suitable place to live. Having been permanently uprooted from their home, they must accept the sad truth that their lives will never be the same again.<br /><br />Working with a running time of just eleven minutes, Griffith has very little time to recruit our sympathies for the primary characters, but he does quite an good job. There\\'s something inherently devastating in watching the tribe marching solemnly away from their spiritual home, a slow, sorrowful procession of broken souls. For some reason, John Ford\\'s \\'The Grapes of Wrath (1940)\\' \\x96 another film about a displaced family \\x96 came immediately to mind during these sequences; it\\'s an uneven comparison, of course, but that\\'s just the association that my brain made. Griffith almost fools us into accepting a makeshift happy ending, as one settler suddenly attains a conscience and apologetically returns Silver Eagle\\'s maiden to him, but the conclusion is more tragic than anything else. Silver Eagle mourns at the side of his deceased father, knowing that, even with his sweetheart by his side, his tribe has no home to which they can return. If only for its unique storytelling perspective, \\'The Red Man\\'s View\\' is essential viewing for anybody wishing to experience yet another aspect of America\\'s first great director.',\n",
       " 'I was blown away by the beauty of the actress playing the Indian maiden in this film. From the first moment you see her on screen she looks like you could reach out and touch her, she is so realistic. The D.W. Griffith Years of Discovery liner notes say she was \"unknown.\" Well, that is a crying shame! How could someone not document who she was? She was stunning, and completely believable. If anyone knows who she was, please post it here for posterity.<br /><br />This film was pretty sensitive to the Indians\\' cause, and also showed that the white man could also get along with the Indians when they showed true Christian character towards them. Owen Moore and James Kirkwood perform well. The father\\'s death scene is moving and poignant. Was D.W. Griffith a racist? If he was you couldn\\'t tell it from this film.<br /><br />',\n",
       " \"This solemn little tale is often held up as one of the more remarkable Biograph westerns. While Griffith predominantly treated Native Americans sympathetically (albeit patronisingly so) The Red Man's View, as the title suggests, differs in that it tells a story solely from the Indian perspective.<br /><br />What is really interesting is how he uses physical arrangements to show this point of view and the protagonists' plight. The white men appear over the hillside as a kind of characterless swarm \\x96 an impersonal force, rather than a group of individuals. The Indians on the other hand advance slowly across the landscape in single file, dignified, each one an individual.<br /><br />This is one of Griffith's first really great outdoor pictures. The vast empty spaces allow for maximum impact as actors approach us from the distance. This use of depth had a massive influence on Charlie Chaplin \\x96 think of how many times the little tramp entered or exited a scene over a great distance, all the better to show off that unique walk. In the final scenes the wind howls across the wasteland \\x96 a great bit of atmospherics that was pioneering for its time.<br /><br />1909 was a period of incredibly speedy development in Griffith's style and competence. We go from nonsense like The Voice of The Violin and What Drink Did earlier in the year, to this simple yet stylish piece of storytelling. However, the best was yet to come with Griffith's very next picture \\x96 A Corner in Wheat.\",\n",

       " \"<br /><br />I can't help asking these questions while watching most of Franco's movies from the late seventies, early eighties. And this one is a good example of this period in his career.<br /><br />If you have seen Vampyros Lesbos or Female Vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill) you basically know the story. In Vampyros Lesbos there's a stunning vampire girl (Soledad Miranda) who rather sucks the blood out of other females than out of men and in the end dies.<br /><br />In Female Vampire there's the same eternally young girl this time sucking on genitalia instead of necks to keep her youth and satisfy her hunger. She also dies in the end, although she commits suicide if I remember correctly. Alternate versions of this movie have the vampire girl actually drinking blood to bypass censorship.<br /><br />Doriana Grey, filmed 3 years later and again featuring the ravishing Lina Romay playing lead, basically recycles the same story but doesn't make any compromises.<br /><br />Doriana Grey, an eternal youth, is living all alone up in a castle with her mute servant and keeps her youth by sucking the life out of innocent girls with the occasional man on the menu. In the end she satisfies herself and dies, floating in a small swimming pool, just as the Female Vampire dies playing with herself in a bath filled with blood.<br /><br />This brings me back to my three basic questions.<br /><br />Is it porn?<br /><br />Sure, it is. I wouldn't call this family entertainment. You get a lot of masturbation scenes (and I mean a lot!), a couple of lesbian scenes and some man-woman action. There are extreme close-ups of female genitalia and scenes that can only be considered as hardcore porn.<br /><br />On the other hand, most of the sexual partners of Miss Grey die and she is not having any fun, at least, according to the story she's not supposed to have. I'm not an expert on porno-storylines but I don't find it very erotic to see people die after having sex. So, in some way, this is hardly an erotic movie.<br /><br />Is it exploitation?<br /><br />Definitely. It is a prima example of seventies erotic cinema from the seventies. It might not be very erotic nowadays, but it was shot to be.<br /><br />Is it Franco?<br /><br />Affirmative. Although it's more explicit than earlier Franco movies, it still contains some of his trademarks:<br /><br />- Out-of-focus camera work. Many scenes have Franco play with the focus, making many parts very confusing and giving it a dream-like quality.<br /><br />- Zoom in - zoom out. Franco has often been critized for using the zoom lens too often. Others defend the director, saying he only did that during a short period of his career (i.e. 1968-1971). Still, in this movie there's a lot of zooming going on.<br /><br />- Completely useless shots. This is one of my favorite Franco trademarks, the ability to move the camera to a completely useless part of the scenery, focusing on rain pouring down or a leaf against the dark sky. This can be explained by Franco's own words, claiming to be a voyeur. He doesn't only focus on female genitalia, he's also a voyeur of the beauty of the ordinary world.<br /><br />- Storyline. I've already discussed the similarity between this movie and other Franco movies like Vampyros Lesbos and Female Vampire, but there's more. He frequently uses characters that are mute or have a speaking disability (e.g. Lina Romay plays a mute vampire in Female Vampire), in Doriana Grey the servant is a mute who used to be a protest singer (!); a girl locked in asylum, telepathically connected to someone in the outside world. This can be traced back to Murnau's Nosferatu, but it is also a recurring storyline in Franco's movies. And then there's the doctor in the asylum who goes by the name of Dr. Orlof, a name you'll find as early as 1959 (The Awful Dr. Orlof). Dr. Orlof in turn seems like a reference to Murnau's Nosferatu again (Count Orlok).<br /><br />So in the end, what have I just seen? A typical Franco movie who continues to move towards pure sex movies and leaving the horror genre altogether, keeping up with the zeitgeist. Definitely a must for Franco fans but not a very good place to start.<br /><br />One last word: the DVD, released by the producer Erwin C. Dietrich, has been completely restored, cleaned up and digitally mastered and looks perfect in every way. This is how they should treat all movies before transferring them to DVD.<br /><br />\",\n",
       " \"In my humble opinion this is one of the best Jess Franco films ever. Lina Romay is hot as hell, mostly spending her time masturbating away. The film has an eerie hallucinatory feeling to it, like watching porn in slow motion while on dope. Beware: There are two versions on the market, one is softcore and not that good, one is full hardcore and that's the one I'm refering to. Erwin C.Dietrich told me he was given this film as a gift from Jess Franco in gratitude but never really done anything with it. Finally, due to the DVD revolution it's finally out on silver disc, And it's looking absolutely stunning! Check it out!\",\n",
       " \"Not much of young Oscar left in this but I guess that once Jess caught sight of that Ms Romay's swinging bottom and breasts, he was soon too mesmerised to worry overly about plot details. And one can sympathise, Lina Romay is naked throughout the film and seemingly perfectly happy to not only reveal all but to get down and very dirty in a surprisingly explicit Franco outing. Nudity is hardly unknown in the 'dirty old man's' films but were this not so different in feel to accepted hardcore, that is the label one might find appropriate. Elegantly shot in widescreen this is a colourful, erotic tale with surprising moments hinting at vampirism and despite the appalling dubbed dialogue very watch able and amazingly possibly one of Romay's best.\",\n",
       " 'Doriana Grey should please Franco\\'s admirers, leaving others alternately bored, confused, and aroused in spite of themselves. As with others of the director\\'s films, there\\'s a dreamlike quality to the proceedings, with wealthy and ennui-afflicted recluse Doriana strolling leisurely through her home or staring at the sky between sexual encounters played out to tranquil sitar music.<br /><br />Some of the actors seem to be playing their parts in a trance, as if hypnotized before shooting, like the cast of Herzog\\'s Heart of Glass. The English dubbing, too, is mostly monotone, which only enhances, rather than hurts, the timeless, otherworldly atmosphere, with dialogue ranging from the seemingly lofty (\"It is the destiny of all beauty to be destroyed\") to the simply lewd (\"Go down on me\").<br /><br />The DVD, as of writing, has long gone out of print, but Franco enthusiasts are encouraged to look for this one through gray market services. The staring, frightening lust expressed in Lina Romay\\'s eyes alone is worth at least one visit to her château.',\n",
       " \"A magnificent adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, enhanced by the splendor of Rome at its full glory under Julius Caesar. Charlton Heston is at his best as Marc Anthony and makes you feel as if Shakespeare wrote the part for him. I have mixed feelings about the choice of John Gielgud as Caesar. There are times in the movie that he portrays Caesar well as the aloof dictator and others when he overacts as he does in most of his roles. Jason Robards is a fine actor, but not as Brutus, unless Stuart Burge intended to experiment with this role as a Spaghetti Western. Robard's dialogue is wooden. Robert Vaughn shines as Casca as does Richard Johnson as Cassius. Richard Chamberlain portrays well a self opinionated Octavius Caesar. The opening of the movie is a masterpiece of imagery and impact and one is plunged into the involvement of the triumphal entry of Julius Caesar into Rome and the aftermath. Why on earth there has been no DVD release of this movie beggar's belief.\",\n",
       " \"One of the things that I always thought about Julius Caesar is that in the life of one of the great movers and shakers of the ancient world, he's merely a figure in which all kinds of people at the end are busy weaving their schemes around, be it his death or his conferred immortality. <br /><br />Antony and Brutus are each worried about their place in Caesar's affections and Brutus figures he's lost out to Antony. It makes him an easy mark for Cassius's plots. After the dirty deed of assassination is done, it's Antony and Octavius though they are teaming up against the conspirators, you can tell both in this version and in the better Fifties version that MGM put out that they will soon be at odds.<br /><br />Charlton Heston is a strong Antony here, but unfortunately for the play to succeed you need an equally strong Brutus. That's not what you get in Jason Robards, Jr. For a man who in his time was considered the greatest interpreter of Eugene O'Neill, when it comes to Shakespeare the man was out of his league. No reflection on him, everyone has casting limitations.<br /><br />A real good interpreter of the Bard who played Cassius back in 1954 plays Caesar here. John Gielgud is equally fine in both versions. And Richard Johnson and Robert Vaughn are superb as conspirators Cassius and Casca. And Richard Chamberlain who was trying very hard to shed his Dr. Kildare image is fine as the cunning Octavian who Antony ultimately underestimates.<br /><br />Charlton Heston in his memoirs takes blame for casting Robards and Robards himself realized he was miscast. Oddly enough in that earlier version James Mason as Brutus was the best one in the film.\",\n",
       " \"Much better than the earlier Julius Caesar, which starred Marlon Brando as Mark Antony and James Mason as Brutus. In this version, Jason Robards as Brutus is admittedly an embarrassment, but the rest of the cast is quite strong. The delivery of Antony's funeral oration by Charlton Heston is brilliant, powerful, well-paced, the dramatic high point of the movie. Richard Johnson as Cassius, John Gielgud as Caesar, Robert Vaughn as Casca and Diana Rigg as Portia are fine actors, with full dramatic presence, at home in Shakespeare's language. Brief parts, like the soothsayer's and the cobbler's, are memorably played. The screenplay omits two short passages that are important to the plot: (1) Cassius' avowal in the first act, after his attempt to persuade Brutus to oppose Caesar, that if their positions were reversed and he, Cassius, stood as well with Caesar as Brutus does, and Brutus made a comparable appeal to him, he would certainly not listen. (2) Immediately after the assassination, a promise by Brutus to Antony's servant of safe conduct for Antony, who thus knows when he comes to the Capitol and weeps over Caesar's body, challenging the conspirators to kill him also, that there is no danger of their doing so.\",\n",
       " \"This is a pretty good film version of the play. Sure, Jason Robards is a little stiff at first, but he gets better as the film goes on. John Gielgud is fine as to be expected. Charlton Heston does an admirable job as Antony. Overall, this is a very good movie version that doesn't take a backseat to the earlier Mason/Brando version. Try to follow it up with the Antony and Cleopatra with Charlton Heston taking up the Antony role again. They complement each other well.\",\n",
       " \"As others have noted, Jason Robards' performance as Brutus has real problems, particularly at the start. While playing the character as vague and distracted is certainly justified by the text, Robards often appears just this side of comatose. James Mason was far better in the older film version. <br /><br />The biggest and best surprise is Heston's strength as Antony. He believably conveys an interesting mixture of loyalty, craftiness, and ambition. And his work in the funeral oration is well-paced and well-directed. Overall, this version has a lot going for it -- it's among the better Shakespeare adaptations that I know of.<br /><br />\",\n",
       " \"This is a film built entirely for fans of Shakespeare. If you want a truly cinematic version, try the Brando version. This version is as true to Shakespeare as any film I have seen. John Gielgud in his second Julius Caesar film role, this time as Caesar himself, is studied and brilliant. Brutus plays off of Antony well as the weaker of the generals. Surprisingly, Heston plays a brilliant Antony, strong and resilient, as Antony should be played, and showing a serious command of the language and supernatural world of Shakespeare's Caesar. I recommend this film for any true reader or scholar of Shakespeare as the definitive Julius Caesar film adaptation. If you want Hollywood-type entertainment, go for the earlier but flashier Brando version.\",\n",
       " 'Julius Caeser was an enigmatic character historically, as well as in Shakespeare\\'s portrayal of him. Reading his works in Latin is both a delight and wonder. The propaganda of the Gallic Wars lays the foundation for wartime journalism, portraying the enemy as something slightly less than human and the cause of the invaders as something noble and enlightened. Having said this, one looks at the Bard\\'s depiction of Caeser\\'s assassination and his portrayal of Caeser as something different from History.<br /><br />Sir John Gielgud was always stately in whatever role he played. He was an excellent Cassius in the 1955 version but seems a bit distanced in his role as the Dictator. One reviewer accuses him of being a ham and \"overacting.\" Well, thanks for sharing that unshared opinion. Heston plays Moses playing Marc Anthony and Jason Robards grumbles his lines as Brutus. The real role that justifies the price of admission is that of the Brit, Richard Johnson whose angry, sullen Cassius stands out against Robards\\'s wooden Brutus. Christopher Lee and Robert Vaughn both execute their roles splendidly as do the ladies, Jill Bennett and the ever lovely Diana Rigg. The pretty boy role of Octavius by Richard Chamberlain was merely OK and clumsy and the fight scenes seem a bit cranky compared to what we see today. But, we\\'re in it for Shakespeare, not a shoot\\'em or garish cast of thousands recreating bloody battle scenes.<br /><br />I prefer the 1955 version with the Ham of hams, Brando as Mark Antony and Louis Calhern as Caesar. There, the great Gielgud and a competent James Mason made the respective roles of the conspirators, Cassius and Brutus sparkle.',\n",
       " \"This good rendition of the Shakespeare playwright talks about tragedy, ambition, politics, corruption and wars. The film starts in battle of Munda where Julius Caesar(100-40 b.c.) vanquished Pompeyo and terminates in battle of Filipos where the second triumvirate(Marco Antonio, Lepido and Octavius Augustus: Richard Chamberlain) vanquish Brutus and Cassio. Aristocrat party prepares a conspiracy and March 15, 44 b.c -Idus of March- Julius Caesar was assassinated in senate .Remains surprisingly true to Shakespeare's adaptation and working directly from the original, unlike many other historical movies of the same era. The Caesar killing is originally staged including unexpected frames of the murderous washing their hands in the blood of Julius and below of Pompeyo sculpture.<br /><br />There are magnificent acting from a memorable Charlton Heston as Marco Antonio, an electrifying John Gielgud as Caesar, a sneaky Robert Vaughn as Casca and a splendid Richard Johnson as Cassius, among them. Performances attractive enough extends right down to the minor characters, wealthy of expert character-drawing, as Christopher Lee, Diana Rigg and Andre Morell as Ciceron. Directed with imagination and professionalism by Stuart Burge and well produced by Peter Snell who followed with a sequel also little known 'Marco Antonio and Cleopatra' starred and directed by Charlton Heston.This gripping flick will like to Shakespeare devotees but its spirit is intact in spite of are taken some liberties. It's hard to believe this underrated film did not have success, today is best deemed but contains brilliance of dialogue perfectly played by all-stars. Despite this one turns out to be inferior than classic film 'Julius Caesar(1953)' considered definitely the best version available directed by Joseph L Mankiewicz and starred by top American players as Marlon Brando( similar role Charlton Heston-Marco Antonio), Louis Calhern(John Gielgud-Caesar), Greer Garson(Jill Bennet-Calpurnia),James Mason(Jason Robards-Brutus), Edmond O'Brien(Robert Vaughn-Casca role) among others.\",\n",
       " 'By now in his late forties and sporting an obvious, bright red hairpiece, Charlton Heston seemed an odd Antony when first seen. But Heston remained fit all through his long career. While he does not as much look the part, his Marc Antony provides a sturdy center for this second filming of the Shakespeare tragedy. Also, Charlton Heston had a scholarly side unusual for a Hollywood actor. He clearly gave much thought to this portrayal which on the whole is better than the misplaced Method emoting of Marlon Brando\\'s Antony, some seventeen years earlier. <br /><br />Featuring a mixed cast of British and American actors, the result is mainly predictable but some surprises and disappointments also feature. One disappointment is Gielgud as Caesar. Sir John was a veteran Shakespearian by 1970 with a fine voice and tons of dignity. Yet at sixty-six he was a touch too old for the part. More to the point, the effete Gielgud lacked the masculine force to play this virile ex-general whose battlefield victories were said to be matched only by his conquests in the bedroom. <br /><br />One surprise is the subtle portrayal of the conspirator Casca by American Robert Vaughan. \"Sour\" Casca, the cynical observer, is a minor character but sharply drawn and Vaughan makes him come alive during his few minutes on stage. Jill Bennet is sympathetic as the prophetic wife of Caesar but in the role of Brutus\\' wife the well-born Portia, Diana Rigg at age thirty-two looks luscious and is simply superb--Shakespeare in the finest style. Another veteran Shakespearian, Richard Johnson, is nearly as good as the jealous, manipulative Cassius.<br /><br />Jason Robards plays Brutus like a wooden Indian for the first two acts. In the third act however--that is, after Brutus and Cassius have fled Rome--he seems to grow in the part and his acting gains conviction. <br /><br />The importance of the plebeians to the play was understood by this director, who cast the roles carefully.',\n",
       " 'Seua khaap daap (aka - The Tiger Blade) is a fast paced martial arts and gun fight action film set in modern day Bangkok. Yosthana (\"Yos\") is a smart young \"Special Agent\" who uses technology, a magic sword, guns and a healthy dose of martial arts skill to vanquish dozens of bad-guys, some of whom are protected by magic. Along with a team of sometimes comical special agents they chase and fight the henchmen of notorious rebel Commander \"Kao Yod\". Plot holes and twists are plentiful but the well scripted action scenes and high (for Thailand) production values make the film enjoyable. Don\\'t expect as slick a film as a modern Hong Kong production and you won\\'t be disappointed. Think more like along the lines of an early 90\\'s Jackie Chan or Chow Yun-Fat action movie and you\\'ll be thoroughly delighted.<br /><br />*Note - The version I saw contained some sort of fuzzy pixelization censorship of a) cigarettes when in someone\\'s mouth but not in their hands, and b) guns when pointed directly at someone in the same frame. Bloody scenes of bullets striking heads and chests, a body exploding, and faces being punched were not!?!?! \\x85go figure.<br /><br />Finally, this film contains no nudity but it is filled with violence, a bit of sex and a sexual assault. I don\\'t have kids but I would think this warrants PG-13 treatment.',\n",
       " \"OK maybe the special effects and the storyline are not that great, but as a cool action flick, the tiger blade rocks. The duration of the movie is 110 min and it contains almost 80 minutes of non-stop action. The movie has only begun or the action explodes on the screen. You have bullet-ballets, go-cart-chases, kick-ass-fighting and always with a funny undertone. I recently watched Born to Fight and Tom-Yum-Goong, and OK the action sequences are better made, but in total, both movies we're rather disappointing. Both these movies we're made with much bigger budgets, but The Tiger Blade is more enjoyable and a second viewing will not be a problem. I'd actually want to see it again.\",\n",
       " \"The Tiger Blade starts with a great kick off and manage to hold that throughout the entire movie. The story might not be that clear but actually it doesn't matter. You just go with the flow and accept the holes in the story which are filled in with great action scenes. It's Thai and of course you're thinking about Ong-bak but The Tiger Blade does use wire work and probably stunt men but it does't mean the action would be less. The direction is good and it shows that the greatest attention went to the action aspect. Would that bother? The story of Ong-bak isn't also that great. Just forget the story, tolerate the acting performances and you're settled for a good action ride. It deserves your attention when you loved Ong-bak and the Russian Night Watch because it's a perfect combination of those two.\",\n",

So, at least there are good fight scenes ? No. Special effects are cheap. It's all a rehash of previous films, notably Matrix, but with inferior quality.<br /><br />Everything sucks in this movie ! Lousy acting, totally boring, this flick is an insult to the viewer. Avoid !<br /><br />Sometimes the absence of a plot is preferable to a really crappy one. Take the Doom video games, for instance. Who cares why you're there as long as there are aliens to shoot ?\",\n",
       " \"The Columbo formula was thrown out the window here. Unfortunately, so was the pacing. The result is one of the most boring entries of the series -- complete with a Columbo who seems to be making fun of himself half of the time. At the end, since Columbo didn't seem to care that much about catching the killer, I lost interest too.\",\n",
       " 'The milieu here is the family and friends of the Commodore (John Dehner), very rich folks. The Commodore is murdered and just as we think Columbo has the killer (Robert Vaughan) cornered, he\\'s murdered too. Columbo assembles all the possible suspects in a room at the end and goes through a Charlie Chan or Hercule Poirot routine to expose the real killer, whose motive turns out to be greed.<br /><br />This is thin stuff although the director (Patrick McGoohan, a talented actor) tries to lay it on with a trowel. I would guess the script started off as an hour-long show for \"Mannix\" or \"Dan August\" or something. There are many attempts to pad it out with humor and none of them are funny. (See Lieutenant Columbo try to wrestle himself into a FULL LOTUS POSITION! That\\'ll be ten cents.) Characters get rather elaborate introductions and then play no more than the usual minor roles. Worse, this is a somewhat different Columbo than the character his fans have come to know. He\\'s bumbling, of course, and has to cope with the difference between a mainmast and a mizzenmast, but on top of that he\\'s CUTE. He winks. He smiles. His comments are coy. And what does it all boil down to? A two-minute experiment at the end in which the killer reveals his guilt. The rest were all red herrings.<br /><br />There would be worse episodes after the series was revived and wrung out, but this is certainly one of the weakest of the original series, despite the talent in front of, and behind, the camera.',\n",
       " 'I won\\'t post any spoilers for this film; but if you\\'re going to watch this unpopular \"Columbo\" entry anyway, I recommend you don\\'t read this, or any other review, until afterward.<br /><br />Charlie Clay (Robert Vaughn) runs a ship building business owned by his father-in-law, Commodore Otis Swanson (John Dehner), who is not happy with the wastrel\\'s shady dealings. Nor is he pleased with any of the people closest to him, including his alcoholic daughter Joanna Clay (Diane Baker), his elderly nephew Swanny Swanson (Fred Draper) or his lawyer Kittering (Wilfred Hyde-White). Soon the Commodore is murdered; and Charlie Clay covers it up by impersonating the Commodore, taking the corpse out on the man\\'s yawl at night and throwing the body overboard. Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk) investigates this case with the help of a veteran sergeant (Bruce Kirby) and a 29-year-old novice (Dennis Dugan). Our rumpled, redoubtable detective knows Clay covered up the crime. But his assumption that Clay committed the crime may prove premature.<br /><br />The reason you shouldn\\'t read any reviews is because they invariably call this is a whodunit. That makes it a departure from the usual \"Columbo\" formula, in which we always see the murder take place. But the word \"whodunit\" gives away the surprise an hour into the film\\x97in which we learn, along with Columbo, that who we thought had done it, hadn\\'t done it.<br /><br />Actually, it\\'s not that much of a surprise. \"Columbo\" fans will know something is up right away, since we see the cover-up but not the murder itself. We always get to see the murder, we lucky brutes. This unusual episode has two precedents. \"Double Shock\" also withholds important information during the murder scene\\x97in order to surprise us later. \"A Friend in Deed\" also has one person covering up the murder for someone else.<br /><br />\"Columbo\" is one of those rare series that succeeds because of a strict formula, not in spite of it. Even many mystery series leave us craving more variety. The only parallel I can make is an odd one: Chuck Jones\\'s \"Road Runner\" series also works because of its formula. The closer it hues to it, the funnier it is. This film should join the post-Jones \"Road Runner\" shorts in one grave marked, \"If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.\"<br /><br />Everything is wrong with this entry, directed by Patrick McGoohan from a script by Jackson Gillis. The pacing is jerky and awkward. The performances are bad: Diane Baker, a good actress, overplays her role as a drunk; Peter Falk is weirdly aggressive and self-satisfied as Columbo. The characters seem manipulated into acting the way they do, instead of behaving like real people. Lt. Columbo has all the suspects gather into one room for a classic Agatha Christie-style ending; but the solution to the mystery is a complete bore.<br /><br />Here\\'s a question for those who have already seen this (not a spoiler): Why wouldn\\'t the Commodore have reused the \"S\" stencil rather than asking for two?',\n",
       " \"I love the Columbo series, have seen at least 80 percent of the show's episodes, and hope to eventually see them all. So far, this one is by far the worst. What makes it so disappointing is that it has a wonderful supporting cast: John Dehner, Diane Baker, Robert Vaughn, Wilfrid Hyde-White, and Dennis Dugan, among others. But what a waste of talent. And what terrible pacing and staging. Patrick McGoohan is a fine actor, and his performances as the murderer in this series are outstanding. But his directing in this episode is simply awful. If you're a Columbo fan, skip this one. If you're not a Columbo fan, all the more reason to skip it as well!\",\n",
       " \"I really like Patrick McGoohan's most other directed Columbo movies really much, since his directing style certainly give the movies something extra. However he went too far with this movie. The directing and story-telling in general is different from the usual Columbo movie formula. It's a real slow moving movie, in which the killer himself also isn't known to the viewers this time, until of course the very ending. It's obvious they wanted to try something different for the Columbo series, as they tried numerous times before and after this movie as well. Funny though that they always went back to the usual Columbo style we all are so accustomed to.<br /><br />Really problem with this movie is its pacing. It's annoyingly slow. Sequences seem to go on for ever without getting to its point. It really makes you wonder why the movie wasn't provided with any more pace. At one point Lt. Columbo goes into a trance. The actual movie itself also really feels like it goes into a trance though. It really doesn't make this movie a pleasant one to watch. It's not like the story is anything too bad, or the approach of not revealing who the killer is, or how the murder was committed, until the very end, is a bad one but it just doesn't work out with this type of directing approach as got picked by Patrick McGoohan, who is probably also better known and respected as an actor than a director really.<br /><br />One thing McGoohan still does right though is the movie its humor. He is one of those directors who understood the Columbo character well and knew how to throw in the right kind of relieving humor, involving the character. Though being a close personal friend of Peter Falk, he probably gave him a bit too much room though to do his comedy thing, since he definitely goes a bit over-the-top with it at times. Oh well, at least he still probably had lots of fun with it.<br /><br />Poor Robert Vaughn. He's a great actor but the Columbo movies he has starred in just aren't among the greatest. He deserved better, also since he seems really like an actor who is the right guy for playing these type of roles in these types of movies.<br /><br />Tiresome off-boat Columbo entry. It has a good typical Columbo ending though.<br /><br />4/10\",\n",
       " 'This departure from the basic Columbo script works out well, for once. For reasons not revealed here, Columbo\\'s singular murder suspect has to be dropped from consideration. From then on, the show becomes more like a classical whodunit. After some twists and turns, the conclusion has Columbo in a room full of potential culprits, smoking out the guilty one. Columbo is as clever, adept, and at home with this tactic as in his usual one-on-one battles. And there\\'s no skimping on the touches that make \"Columbo\" a unique and special detective show.',\n",
       " 'About thirty minutes into the film, I thought this was one of the weakest \"Columbo\"s ever because it had the usual beginning (a murder happening, then Columbo coming, inspecting everything and interrogating the main suspect) squared! It was boring because I thought I knew everything already.<br /><br />But then there was a surprising twist that turned this episode into a most exciting one. Suddenly, many characters were involved, I started to guess with Columbo and the ending was just like Agatha Christie\\'s Poirot endings are.<br /><br />The film is full of irony, and looking back, I must admit that the whole episode is great work of the writers because the ordinary first part is a mere tool for creating this irony, creating a huge fool-the-audience-scenario. Don\\'t turn your television off before the end!',\n",
       " '\"Last Salute\" is an episode directed by Falk\\'s friend McGoohan and from start to finish the viewer can enjoy what is almost a pastiche of a crime mystery. Columbo lingers in the harbor, in no hurry at all, works together with Mac (because his boss insists), makes him drive his car, gets entangled with Robert Vaughn in the car, with the telephone, tries TM on the deck of the boat. He seems in a jolly mood all the time. Note how he touches and lays his arms around everyone in this episode. It is an episode as calming as the waterfront itself. And it probably isn\\'t up to what most viewers expect. But that always is a problem. We need to accept it as a creative thing too. And Columbo always had it\\'s own patterns and in-jokes, but because of many different directors as well as guest stars and considering the fact that the show ran for 35 years, there is no such thing as the one formula it sticks to. So it is really quite sad that there are always these remarks \\'the last of the real Columbo\\'s\\', \\'the final good episode\\', \\'here\\'s where episodes became to long\\', \\'here\\'s where Falk was too old\\', etc, etc. Enjoy every episode for its own merits. \"Last Salute\" is in no way possible to be compared with outings like \"Double Exposure\" of \"A Stitch in Crime\". So don\\'t. Just sit, relax and watch this episode. And there is no episode like it, it is beyond comparison.',\n",

Both Vaughn and Hyde-White are Columbo veterans by now, I love the unusual love story in this film an I won't spoil it for the viewers. I love Columbo and have seen almost all of them about a hundred times. The Commodore is murdered. While he was a proud businessman, he is disgusted by the greedy vultures that seem more interested in money than sailing. He had created an empire from building boats, yachts, and ships. Diane Baker plays his alcoholic daughter and I believe she is one of the best actresses around who doesn't get enough credit or work in my opinion. Robert Vaughn plays her husband. There are a lot more twist and turns in this episode than the usual Columbo episode but it's always entertaining and worth watching with great actors.\",\n",
       " \"While the camera shots in this movie are often not clearly focused and the editing is poor with harsh cuts that should have been faded to black or into the next scene, this movie isn't half bad. The soundtracks not bad either, but perhaps with better editing, the featured songs would have fit in a lot better.<br /><br />I have ulterior motives as to why I purchased this movie (it's all Amy's fault) and have been pleasantly surprised recently at how well Scott Baio can pull off the leading man in movies which revolve around the romance genre - he can really make you feel for the characters he portrays, making you cross all your fingers, toes, legs etc, hoping that things will work out for the best.<br /><br />The storyline revolves around Mario, a cocky young up-and-coming photographer from Little Italy who literally falls in love at first sight with with Nicole Yeats (hence the title - I <3 N.Y.), the daughter of John Robertson Yeats(Plummer), a prestigious actor starring on Broadway. After a little persuasion, Nicole agrees to go on a date with Mario and together they start a relationship which ruffles the feathers of her father, his mother and his boss (Orbach).<br /><br />It's pretty much an 80's Romeo and Juliet tale - without the tragic end. He's from a low class background trying to make it big and she's from a high class background where she could have anything she wants.<br /><br />The chemistry between Baio and Kelly Van Der Velden is fantastic. It's this that makes this movie worthwhile, although there are fantastic performances from Plummer as Nicole's tyrannical father and Orbach as Mario's frustrated boss.<br /><br />I pretty much have to say that, even though these type of movies are so clichéd, I was rooting for the young couple and half expected them to elope together to annoy her their respective parents. There's some great dialogue between characters, particularly Mario and Nicole when they first meet and there's a few funny moments too. <br /><br />If you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it as it's a great chick flick, perfect for a Saturday night in with that bottle of red and the girls.\",\n",

He gives her clues as to who will die next. She starts to piece together the puzzle and must stop him before he claims her life next.<br /><br />Basically it's a comedy/horror, the film doesn't take itself very seriously and is full of random humour. You'll laugh out loud at most of the scenes. It's still a horror movie and contains plenty of innovative and gory kills. Overall, I recommend it to horror fans or anyone who has 1 hour 23 min's to spare for a few laughs, it's the kind of film you simply switch your brain off and enjoy :)\",\n",

There was some sort of weird, political subtext that was a bit obnoxious, but it didn\\'t seem to hurt things too badly. The beginning was a bit \"Malibu\\'s Most Wanted\" for my taste, (ie really dumb wigger jokes) but that passed. All in all, it has some awesomely cheesy moments, and I\\'d say this is a must see for all fans of really bad horror movies.',\n",
       " \"Considering some of the reviews here and elsewhere and the lack of any big names, I was more than a little skeptical going into this film. My suspicions turned out to be unfounded, though, as the film was actually surprisingly good.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've heard a movie soundtrack where the bulk of the songs were not only performed by people born in the last 20 years, but they were performed well. A good soundtrack is hard to find and adds SO much to a movie. You can have a pretty mediocre film and add a great soundtrack and it ends up being quite watchable.<br /><br />Some of the acting is a little wooden and the plot is almost laughably cliché. One could argue, though, that a laughably cliché plot was their goal, that they were somehow trying to recreate the far-fetched plot horror flicks of years past. If so, they did it masterfully.<br /><br />I was expecting a very low budget, but it really didn't look that way. I'm always impressed when low budget movies don't look low budget. The editing was creative, especially the ramping of the kill scenes/killer's movements for increased dramatic effect.<br /><br />Overall, this movie portrayed something that seems to be in short supply on celluloid these days- youthful exuberance. If you are a teenager, or, if, for 83 minutes you can channel the spirit of a teenager, you're in for a fun ride.<br /><br />With a little more money and some better writing, I think these directors will be able to do really great things.

       " \"As a fan of slasher movies, I have to say that the direction in Drive Thru isn't too impressive, often being of the 'point and shoot' variety. In addition, most of the kills take place off-screen, and at first glance the story is also highly unimaginative - a teenage girl called Mackenzie Carpenter ('Mac' to her friends) discovers that pupils at her high school are being killed by a maniac who's dressed as Horny the Clown, the mascot of the Hellaburger fast-food restaurant chain (he looks like the secret love child of Ronald McDonald and Satan).<br /><br />So far, so clichéd. But Drive-Thru's script then proceeds to overturn most of the conventional rules of the slasher movie genre.<br /><br />For example, traditionally the heroine in these films is always a quiet, likable, well behaved and respectable young girl who is often bullied or victimised by the popular in-crowd. Not so in Drive-Thru. Here, the Final Girl is a foul mouthed, drug-taking teen who thinks her parents are morons, and - together with her emo friends - behaves appallingly to anyone she doesn't like. There's even a clever subplot in which we learn that she's decided not to sleep with her older boyfriend until she reaches the age of consent - but just as it seems that the movie is finally reverting to convention, she changes her mind and has underage sex with him anyway (!).<br /><br />Another slasher cliché is the creepy janitor, who often acts as either a prime suspect or red herring, but again Drive-Thru acts as though it's playing the game, only to suddenly perform a bodyswerve and wrong-foot us. So yes, the creepy janitor is dutifully introduced, but he promptly gets killed in the very next scene.<br /><br />The movie also skilfully satirizes current American youth culture: in addition to Mac's emo friends, Horny also takes his machete to handgun-flaunting wiggas, right-wing WASP preppies, goth wiccans, and stoner drop-outs. There's also a surprisingly political edge that's rare in the genre: Mac is described as a vegetarian left-wing liberal, and the dialogue contains quite a few barbs aimed at the Bush administration and Republicans in general. Mac also regards the police as incompetent fascists, and doesn't tell them anything she's discovered about the murders because she believes she's got a better chance of uncovering who the killer is. In fact, the female detective in charge of the case is actually highly efficient, but her investigation is being hampered by Mac's refusal to share information.<br /><br />The cast all deliver solid performances, with Leighton Meester (who plays Mac) being a particular find. There's also a funny cameo from Supersize Me writer/director Morgan Spurlock as a Hellaburger manager.<br /><br />But despite being a highly entertaining movie, Drive-Thru isn't particularly scary. Horny is a colourful and visually striking psycho-villain, but the climax of the movie is quite weak, and the only scene that delivers a genuine frisson is when the killer clown empties a gasoline can over Mac as she's tied to a chair (as a prelude to immolating her), and she starts screaming in complete, helpless terror.\",\n",

This is the type of junk you\\'ve seen six dozen of times before already, and every single one of them was better and less insulting to your intellect. The plot is derivative of approximately fifteen other early 80\\'s slasher films, the soundtrack is nefarious (for the last time: heavy-metal and suspense rarely mix!), the characters are insupportable stereotypes and the maniacal killer (yet another evil clown) is the complete opposite of menacing, with his lame one-liners and overly flamboyant outfit. The film opens with a couple of white trash guys who desperately wish to be black thugs and their arrogant behavior and incomprehensible slang pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film. Seriously, are American teenagers really this stupid nowadays? Luckily they quickly get massacred by Horny the Clown, the Ronald McDonald of fast food restaurant \"Hella Burger\" located in Orange County. The serial killer-clown continues his murder spree in the local high school, but his teenage victims \\x96 and particularly their parents \\x96 appear to have something in common, namely a dark secret about a prank that horribly ran out of control and killed a nerdy kid on his 18th birthday party. The concept is as old as the slasher-film itself, yet the writers pretentiously act as if they re-invent the genre and particularly the comical aspects miserably fail their effect. There\\'s zero suspense, or what else did you expect, and the screenplay stupidly enough often hints at supernatural powers even though there\\'s no logical explanation for this. The film tries to be intelligent, and distract you from all the plot-holes and improbabilities, through its main character Mackenzie Carpenter. She\\'s a rebellious, opinionated and politically engaged teenager and, granted, Leighton Meester\\'s presence and cute on screen charisma is unquestionably the movie\\'s main strongpoint. Yet, she also still makes a couple of stupid decisions and all of her friends, including her horny boyfriend, are more than dim-witted enough to compensate for her cleverness. The gore is pretty decent, I have to admit, but overall \"Drive Thru\" is a totally insignificant movie.',\n",
       " \"I saw this film yesterday, and was not impressed. The acting was pretty bad, the gore effects were not great, the story was lacking and the music was terrible, especially during the action sequences.<br /><br />But, I kinda enjoyed myself watching it. There were a few jokes, and most of them were not funny. Most of the fun was because of the lacking script. At some points it was just so stupid, it was funny. I also found the killer clown's remarks entertaining, even though none of them really had much to do with the story. And the concept of a killer clown, though a bit cliché, is still pretty funny.<br /><br />This film is pretty bad, but it's entertaining if you can ignore the flaws, just sit back and laugh at the unfortunate teens.\",\n",
       " 'You know one of those slashers that you shouldn\\'t take seriously at all? This is one such film. I have never laughed with a horror film for a long time. Usually, I watch horror/slashers to be scared but sometimes, very rarely, I watch them for the laughs. I guess I got tired of all the big hit horror movies and decided to go back to B movies.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a group of white kids trying to act gangster. They are calling each other the n word and stuff. They stop at Hellaburger to get something to eat but get more than they bargained for. Right when they pull up, they talk into the speaker and the person on the other end says a bunch of extremely vulgar and sexual remarks about the people in the car. As one of them orders their food, the other attempts to break in to steal the cash. They meet Horny The Clown. A man dressed up in a freaky clown suit, a voice changer attached to the mask, and uses a machete for a weapon. He says a lot of cheesy lines and one of them was stolen from The Shining. It was the line when Jack tells Wendy that, \"I\\'m not going to hurt you, I\\'m just going to bash your brains in, right the *bleep* in\". He says it exactly like Jack. Why should I care? I\\'m having too much fun.<br /><br />Then, you meet Mackenzie Carpenter(Leighton Meester) and her group of friends and they all have one connection and don\\'t even know it. They are all killed one by one and they have no idea why. That is until toward the end of the film, the mother of Mackenzie reveals that the man in the clown suit doing all the killing was bullied by them when they were all in high school. He was accidentally knocked out and the restaurant burned down all around him, killing him. They thought he was dead but apparently not. He is back from the dead to get revenge on the kids. This was stolen from Nightmare on Elm Street. Once again, why should I care? I\\'m having too much fun watching this flick.<br /><br />I didn\\'t see the ending because I was cut off for some reason. It was a good slasher and I would recommend it to those who want a laugh.<br /><br />10 stars out of 10. If You Don\\'t Die From Fast Food, Horny Will Get Ya!',\n",

       " \"Contains some plot spoilers.<br /><br />I desperately tried to like this having first seen it aged eight, but what seemed exciting / scary back then, I find pretty lame now. It's in the style of Raiders of the Lost Ark or Romancing the Stone, but not half as good. Set in Central America (not in South America, where it claims Belize is ) the story follows the US Army setting up a low-frequency transmitter as a navigational aid to subs. As a precaution this 'beacon' is to be hidden deep underground and to help locate a suitable place is elite mercenary and caveman Rupert Wolfson. When men operating the transmitter mysteriously disappear, `Wolf' and some anthropologists help in the search which takes them deep into the mountain. Here they encounter unforeseen perils, including a race of temperamental albinos. Actually filmed in Alabama and Tennessee (Cathedral & Cumberland Caverns respectively) this suffers from dreadful acting and screenplay, plus lack of imagination as the 'mystery' unfolds (not to mention numerous continuity & editing errors) An atmosphere of intrigue and ambiguous wonder is created to (almost) good effect at the beginning, with the opening monologue discussing unexplored wonders of the Earth accompanied by eerie music. This ambience is lost after some badly directed action and almost ruins the following helicopter distorted lens sequence, meandering us through the unwelcoming landscape like a drunkard. `2001'-style wonder is paired with suspense as we enter the caverns, combining some good cave locations with matte artwork and photography. But the camera seems more interested in what our characters are doing. Before long the low budget is apparent and aside from some interesting monsters, we're treated to silly sets and costumes. Characterisation is based on racial stereotypes and the general level of stupidity of that person. Take our main character: he is suave Englishman Wolfson, acting as a consultant for the army; an expert<br /><br />fighter and all around good-guy. No personality flaws, only bad dress<br /><br />sense. Two ugly English (natch) play scientists who are specifically there to die. The female lead (obligatory love interest) is talkie (but not outspoken) Leslie. Working with the Anthropologists she helps extract long-dead remains but will scream when faced with a fresh one. Not too bright. The main American contingent play embarrassingly inept and unprofessional soldiers obsessed with working the transmitter as if their lives depended on it. Wolf's friend George's only importance to the plot is to tell Wolf about the mission. He is a lieutenant and an idiot. There are also several local Latin-Americans assisting the US, one is accident-prone Santos who acts as a plot device to attract the monsters. Acting is at best poor and veteran Robert Powell doesn't even try to get to grips with his (admittedly awful) script. Apparently the main script was being rewritten every day during the shoot and it shows! There are some good `Predator'-style effects as the humans are viewed as a pink glow through the Lemurians' eyes, but their rock-shattering scream was unconvincing. I did like the idea that the Lemurians are sensitive to ultra-sonic waves though. The plot badly loses its way. The buildup is painfully slow and when the 'mystery' is finally resolved, it's a real anti-climax (not giving anything away, let's say not exactly a Close Encounters moment) The idea of discovering creatures deep inside a tropical mountain landscape appealed to me, but `Secrets of the Phantom Caverns' is a letdown. Underground albinos!\",\n",
       " \"OK. First things first. When I watch a film I haven't seen before, I try to keep an open mind. Sometimes this doesn't work, but this time, against all odds, it did.<br /><br />I first saw the film on UK TV as a child under its alias, 'Secrets Of The Phantom Caverns', and it really stuck with me. A few years later I found it on video and still really enjoyed it, especially the lurid vid cover. Now I've managed to find it on DVD, titled 'What Waits Below' (its US title). I'm a very happy man. Its a cheapie, but it's great fun.<br /><br />To be honest it has one winning factor to start with; it stars Robert Powell, an excellent British actor who is great in anything he does. This lifts the film out of the bin already. His recognisable voice is put to good use from the start with an eerie, atmospheric monologue, teamed with a picture that is gradually revealed to be a gigantic stalagmite, Goliath. From this point I was sucked in.<br /><br />As the film continues we meet a few more recognisable faces from the horror genre such as Richard Johnson (The Haunting, Zombie Flesh Eaters) and Lisa Blount (Dead and Buried, John Carpenter's Prince Of Darkness), who, along with other established actors such as Timothy Bottoms, all try and do their very best with the material they have.<br /><br />This is the general motto with the film. Remember, it was done on the cheap, but I think that what's been done, has been done well. You could see it as a well-made, feature film version of Doctor Who, only without the Doctor if that makes any sense! I find the film very atmospheric and quite creepy. The only real mishap may be that when the things that 'wait below' are revealed, they are quite disappointing, but in context this doesn't matter for long.<br /><br />OK, I've done my bit for the film and I hope that this may inspire other people out there to hunt it down and give it a go. Suck in the pride and remember to have a very big pinch of salt at the ready. Enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"I buy a lot of cheap movies, none of them are usually any good but this one surprised me. <br /><br />It is obvious that it had a low budget and the overall film making isn't very good but the ideas behind the story captured my interest. The thoughts of undiscovered caves deep within the earth containing life really excites me. If only this movie could be remade and altered a little on a much larger scale, it could be one of my favourites. <br /><br />This film was let down however by a low budget. The set wasn't bad but the costumes were terrible. The designs of the cavemen looked quite good, the dark eyes, pale skin and increased hearing are what you might imagine from a species who have evolved in a dark cave but I did not like those hairstyles (that's the 80s for you). The acting was poor and some of the characters were pointless. The opening scenes introduced two of the main characters well but other then that it should have been explained what had been going on exactly.<br /><br />Every now and then I'm inspired by a story and want to write something myself along the same lines, this had one of those inspiring stories. I highly recommend watching this if you don't mind B movies.\",\n",

Plus, Lisa Blount, can't go wrong there. Generally I'm against so-called reviews which say 'for what it is it's whatever' but in this case, when something does manage to be genuinely unsettling, I give it a go.

They also don\\'t want to get out of the trip by just returning home over the school break. Two are male friends, Mike Steel (Desmond Harrington), son of a rock star, and Geoff Bingham (Laurence Fox), and two are female friends, Elizabeth Dunn (Thora Birch) and Frances Almond Smith (Keira Knightley). Frances and Geoff have had an intimate relationship, although any relationship between them seems very tenuous, and Elizabeth has had a crush on Mike for a long time; Mike was otherwise going out with another girl, but she had just dumped him. One of them knows, or knows someone who knows, the perfect \"getaway\" spot, secluded and private, just right for promoting an intimate, extended weekend of partying--an old war bunker deep underground in the middle of a forest. The bunker is accessed via a circular, thick steel door, and is lined with thick reinforced concrete. The four end up trapped in the bunker, with the door locked and no way to get out, for at least 10 days. Who locked them in and why? How will they get out? <br /><br />If you\\'re someone who only likes straightforward plots, traditionally happy endings and films depicting \"facts\" that are close to what you believe to be true about the actual world, you\\'re best advised to avoid The Hole. If you instead do not mind, or even prefer, circuitous, twisted tales with strong fantasy elements (in this case primarily to enable what amounts to a parable) and fairly nihilistic endings, you may find much to love here. Reflecting the film\\'s overall ambiguity, The Hole resides in a gray genre area between thriller, psychological horror and a straight-ahead drama. The first half hour or so is much more straightforward, and for me, the film was cruising along at about an 8 for at least that length of time. But as it progressed and things became much more bizarre and \"evil\", my score gradually rose, with the extended climax being a firm 10 for me. So my rating on this one is more of an average.<br /><br />The plot, from a screenplay by first time (and only time so far) scripters Ben Court and Caroline Ip, based on a novel by Guy Burt, is unusual for being told primarily from unreliable characters\\' perspectives. We learn most of the story through the testimony of a victim--Elizabeth, and a primary suspect, Martyn Taylor (Daniel Brocklebank), who may in fact be a friend of Elizabeth\\'s. Their accounts change as the film progresses, often framing different characters as victims and perpetrators, and the bulk of what we see on screen are depictions of these changing accounts. Thus we see some \"repeating\" material. It\\'s important to show parts of the story again as the supposed facts about the story change.<br /><br />Stemming from this, it\\'s easy to see that the performances are quite good. Most characters undergo subtle alterations for the different instantiations of the story, and the four principals--Birch, Harrington, Fox and Knightley--adeptly transform themselves, aided also by their clothing, hair and makeup.<br /><br />Court and Ip cleverly do not change the scenario as much as you might expect after the first couple variations. It keeps you on your toes as to just who the perpetrator was, but also enables a surprising and in-depth exploration of the psychotic personality and motivation behind the \"lock-in\"--whoever the perpetrator was (and I certainly won\\'t reveal the film\\'s answer here), they were clearly somewhat insane. We\\'re also led to be skeptical about the material that\\'s relayed from an ostensibly third-person point of view. It\\'s never clear for most events just what is meant to be \"objective\" and true versus what is still the potential fantasy of the storyteller. Personally, I love that kind of ambiguity. Some others do not like it so much.<br /><br />The Hole is also a bit of an exploration of spoiled kids. All of the main characters are manipulators who are used to getting whatever they want. They all seem to have an attitude that their intellect is far superior to almost every one else, and thus they\\'re entitled to whatever they desire, as well as justified in whatever it takes to get it--that\\'s a classic disposition of many criminals, and not a few business leaders, politicians, Internet geeks and so on. It\\'s notable that when the students\\' parents appear (which is very seldom), they are distant and mostly dissociated from their offspring, who have come to rule the roost as far as we can tell. The investigators trying to piece together the case come to know this, although they never directly state as much, but the performers give very subtle clues to their complex realizations as the story goes on. We can see them also gradually losing hope that they\\'ll be able to properly sort the events out and reveal the truth.<br /><br />The Hole can be seen as a parable about how far some may go to get what they want, as well as how far co-conspirators may go before they try to divorce themselves from events gone wrong (there are clues throughout the film that other characters had various levels of knowledge and involvement). It\\'s also an exploration of what makes some go as far as they do and what makes conspirators play along. At the same time it comments on the bewilderment of \"outsiders\" trying to figure out how some horrific event developed. A lot of the answers are appropriately ambiguous. Under the guises of the subtexts, as well as on a more visceral surface level, the film is a great success.',\n",
       " \"I've been anticipating this film for a while since it is Thora Birch's first role since American Beauty. So, The Hole. The Hole has been hyped up as a horror/psychological film in which 4 students are locked down an old wartime bunker (-the- Hole) to avoid a boring Geography field trip. How does it fare?<br /><br />The casting is probably the jewel of this film. It's superb. The absolutely stunning Keira Knightley (Sabé from Star Wars Episode I) appears as Liz's (Birch) friend, Frankie. All the rest of the characters are complete unknowns, except the psychologist played by Embeth Davidtz (Matilda, Bridget Jones, Schindler's List), but they all act their parts excellently.<br /><br />This film really has the British 'feel' mastered. The sets are excellent, the locations are splendid, and the whole 'feel' of the movie is very realistic. The school really does feel like a British public school (A British 'public school' is like a 'private school' in the US.. one where you need rich parents to flash $$$ to get you in). The unnamed pupils seem extremely realistic.<br /><br />There are only three small flaws with this film. The first is that it doesn't exactly live up to the hype in the British press. I did not find this scary at all, but it was an extremely well done mystery/whodunnit. Horror? Nah, not unless you classify psychological thrillers as 'horror'.<br /><br />The second flaw is that the transitions between different parts of the film can be rather confusing. Often, the film bounds around past and present shots and be extremely disorienting in places. Unlike Memento, this disorientation is not an advantage. However, at the end of the film, you'll be able to tie all of the parts together and leave feeling quite satisfied with the story (a bit like the film 'Wild Things').<br /><br />Another minor let down is the music. Totally forgettable, has no place in the film, and it often appears at the most inappropriate times.<br /><br />I really do hope this is released in the USA soon, as Thora Birch is definitely not to be missed here.. and I think the stunning Keira Knightley is going to be getting some bigger roles from now on, she's definitely earned her stripes here. So, my big question, why has this not been scheduled for US release!?<br /><br />This is certainly not a Blair Witch Project clone, although this impression has been given by the press. Instead, this is a cleverly constructed and extremely well casted psychological thriller/mystery.\",\n",
       " \"Truly, fresh and new ideas, rarely make it to film. The Hole, based on the novel (after the Hole) by Guy Burt is a good exception to this. It is seldom that we see a top quality thriller, but this movie is well cast, well directed, and works wonderfully. The story is quite simple really, it relies on strong characterisation and good dialogue. All the cast give good performances and Thora Birch is outstanding. This thriller really does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout; it is very dark, very creepy and has a terrifying atmosphere. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good thriller. It isn't in the same league as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs, but it is better than most thrillers that are released. <br /><br />8/10 A great film.\",\n",

       " 'THE HOLE tells the tale of four British public (here it would be prep) school students messing around in an old bomb shelter. They accidentally get locked in. After several days, they begin to die off one by one. The lone survivor, played by Thora (GHOST WORLD) Birch, relates her horrific tale as the movie unfolds to investigators, including a doctor (Embeth Davidtz) who follows Birch through her recovery and eventually takes her back down into the shelter. A fellow student who led the four to the shelter is suspected of having locked them in, but has disappeared. This low-budget effort is less a horror flick than a psychological thriller, sort of HIGH TENSION without the barbed-wire baseball bat, although it has its share of grue and contains a couple of highly squeamish moments, the worst involving a pre-PIRATES Keira Knightley. It may remind some of SAW, and I would say rightly so. The end is a shocker, and Birch acts up a storm. Made about five years ago, this is some nasty stuff.',\n",

I was duped into believing this to be a horror film but it is just a dumb mystery psycho-drama with plenty of bad acting, predictable plot development, and an absolutely absurd premise that hasn\\'t got an iota of credibility or realism to it. Birch organizes a \"hole\" excursion so she can starve everyone to death in order to make a guy fall in love with her?!! What a load of crap. What\\'s worse, the entire British police force and its detectives and psychologists can\\'t figure the mystery out, and are deceived by a half-crazed teen who hasn\\'t eaten or drank much for a fortnight!

       " '**WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD**<br /><br />Short version: this movie sucks. Long version: as somebody else wrote, the hole is in the plot line. Or better, there are lots of holes, but mainly:<br /><br />a) Martin has a perfect alibi, yet he\\'s the suspect from the beginning and nobody believes him. But, since they find him (dead) with the key, he MUST be guilty. And Liz must surely be rather strong, if she can plunge him in the river so easily. And rather quick, to put the key in his pocket without anybody (in the audience) noticing. Martin dies only a few yards away from Liz\\'s house, but no one seems to care about that.<br /><br />b) Hello? Did anybody tell the psychologist there were THREE dead bodies in the cell, one of which with his head crushed? How come the police acts as if nothing happened and no one ever talks about it? How come Liz was never questioned SERIOUSLY about these deaths? The first version of the story ends with everybody coming out of the hole happy and smiling, but the psychologist seems to believe it.<br /><br />c) the hole is abandoned since WW II, but there still is electricity. The hole has an emergency exit which can be locked from outside, in order to make it completely unuseful. The door of the hole has a glass part, but nobody tries to break it. <br /><br />d)The door key magically appeared in Martin\\'s pockets some time before, because he won\\'t let us know who gave it to him, and if we knew it, that would mean that someone else knew about the existence of the hole, and that would have made it too complex for the writers.<br /><br />e) Nobody in the school noticed that the boys didn\\'t go to Wales, and their families didn\\'t notice they didn\\'t come home. It took at least three days to understand that there was something wrong.<br /><br />f) Liz is so convincing when she talks, that everybody instantly believes her: see the ending. <br /><br />g) Think about this: when Liz came out, the door was OPEN. If Martin was on holiday, who the hell could open it without a key?<br /><br />I think that\\'s enough to explain why the movie doesn\\'t work.<br /><br />A thriller is a dangerous game: if you want to play it with the audience, you must be sure you can handle it. As many famous screenwriters said, you\\'ve got to take the story and shake its foundations: if it \"survives\", you\\'ve probably got a good movie coming on. This one crumbles quite miserably.',\n",
       " \"If you have seen the trailers (or read some of the reviews), you would be forgiven of thinking of this film as a dark and disturbing thriller, unfortunately, this is not the case.<br /><br />The acting is first rate from the leading five, though Embeth Davidtz, an experienced actress, is confined to a character with little scope for the talents she has displayed in previous films, and I find it disappointing that her acting skills were curtailed by such a restrictive screenplay.<br /><br />And herein lies the main problem for this film. The characterisations are excellent, but the limited experience of the writers shines through. This film has none of the twists and turns you would expect from a thriller, an ending that is at once unconvincing, predictable, and weak, and plot holes you could drive a bus through.<br /><br />Director, Nick Hamm, shows great promise as this film is very well put together, and he certainly gets the best from the main four actors. However he seems to have neglected the talents of everyone else in the film (bar Daniel Brocklebank as Martin).<br /><br />In my opinion, this film was well acted and directed, if only the plot could have been better, we might have seen another classic British film. However I fear that this film will sink into obscurity. It seems a shame that such talent was not used on a film with better writers.<br /><br />I await with anticipation Nick Hamm's next offering, and hope that he finds a screenplay to stretch both himself and the whole cast.\",\n",

With the help of a counsellor, Davidtz, we learn what happens or so we think. As a result of her story, a fellow pupil at her expensive private school is arrested. His version of events is very different. We do not know who to believe, but Davidtz, has doubts about Birch's story. The 'Hole' of the title an old bunker is visited several times during the course of the film. In the final visit Birch tells the whole shocking truth to Davidtz.

And her accent tends to wander off to australia, south africa and back to her native country. Although the rest of the cast seem competent. I was specially impressed by Kiera Knightley as the slutty teen queen. This a refreshing film and an indication that School influenced comdies/dramas/thrillers. can be effectively implemented in England. The U.S bubble gum high school nausea is waring thin in the states and these kind of films have found a fresh ground (U.K) In the hole.

The rest of the largely unknown cast provide excellent support.<br /><br />What brings this film above the run of the mill teen thriller is the intelligence of the writing which places this film nearer \"Se7en\" or \"Fight Club\" than \"Scream\" or \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\".<br /><br />A must see for anyone who likes a film whose scares come from something deeper than loud bangs and psychos in masks, and whose characters have more depth than your average high school cheer-leader.',\n",

This film is a disturbing and cleverly, psychologically frightening film. With a very low blood and sex rating, this film instead shocks by how it manipulates the viewer. For example, as the characters became more and more dehydrated I started to experience the same symptoms as them... clever use of sound and light maybe, but highly effective. I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this film - they might think I was mad! - but I will say that you will be missing out on something if you don't see this film. Provocative, well directed, nicely shot, reasonably scripted, just about acceptably acted. VVG indeed.\",\n",

The cast are surprisingly good, Thora Birch is a talented lead and the other 3 newcomers are very promising. After the first scene and the following horrific flashbacks, audience expectations are very high for a truly terrifying film. On this level, the film doesn't deliver. Unlike the Blair Witch, this isn't that scary. It jumpy, violent and memorable yet not scary. The premise is great and ingeniously explored through uneven flashbacks and the film is nicely directed with some flair. the film also has a clever twist which is deliciously nasty. Overall, this is much better than a lot of the crap that the Americans get away with and this deserves to do well. A thoroughly entertaining film, which will guarantee your undivided attention. 8/10\",\n",

An Interesting take on plot thats been done so many times before, but never quite like this. While its obvious what happens in the end you really want to see it through to the end, so it must have done something right.<br /><br />It's also nice to see that here in Britain we can produce something other than Romantic Comedies and cheap gangster films. Here we have something of a certain class that's quite a good yarn while being far deeper than most US films. I hope it's a sign of things to come.\",\n",

       " \"The nice thing is, that if you bought this because of all the hype about the underage Kiera Knightly flashing, you won't be disappointed and you see a decent movie as well. Thora Birch, sporting a spotty British accent, plays the only survivor of a group of students who hide out on the school holiday by going into a bunker. The Rashomon type plot is a little too simple, we know that the other three are dead and we also know that when four people go somewhere enclosed and one comes out alive, that they had something to do with it. The script never gives us anything else and trying to convince us that nobody even suspects Thora's Liz is unwise. The fractured way that the story unfolds isn't satisfying either since we only have two versions and the second is the one that we know to be true. The saving grace is the cast. Thora, Kiera, and Desmond Harrington are three good young actors and they make these vain characters watchable. Also, even though the script is week, the direction is good. It's one of those jumpy quick cut movies that fits the supposed state of mind that the main character is in as she tries to find the truth. It's an interesting movie with a strong cast that could have used a re-write to flesh out the story.\",\n",

If you like thrillers and mysteries then this is your kind of movie. It may seem a bit predictable at times, but it is well written and gives some unexpected turns. The movie takes place in a past tense with flashes of memory as everyone tries to figure out what happened, including the audience. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie it won\\'t disappoint you, its a good way to pass the time. But if you don\\'t ever watch it, you aren\\'t missing much.',\n",
       " \"The Hole tells the story of an abandoned war bunker hidden deep in the Eglish countryside & the four teenagers who want to spend a few days in it partying, sounds like fun to me. Liz Dunn (Thora Birch) has a huge crush on Mike Steel (Desmond Harrington) the son of an American rock star so arranges the unorthodox gathering & invites her friend Frankie (Keira Knightley) & her boyfriend Geoff (Laurence Fox) who happens to be best mates with Mike, Liz reckons she'll score with Mike no problem. However things don't go according to plan as when they try to leave the bunker they discover the hatch is locked tight. They slowly realise they are trapped, they are running out of water, food & soon the bickering & arguing begins as they wait in hope for someone to rescue them from the hole...<br /><br />This English production was directed by Nick Hamm & I thought The Hole was a top-notch thriller. The script by Ben Court & Caroline Ip is based on the novel 'After the Hole' by Guy Burt & was gripping, clever & engaging. It moves along at a nice pace, it has some nice twists & turns while it's one of those films which really comes together during the final 10 minutes when the truth is finally revealed, it may not come as the biggest shock in the cinematic world but it's effective, satisfying, you'll be thinking about it whether you liked it or not & it ties up everything that has gone before really well. The character's are good & well fleshed out, they didn't seem too clichéd & they were quite likable unlike most American horror/thrillers that rely on teens. On the negative side it's a film which I won't want to watch again in a hurry simply because once the twists are revealed the films impact is all but lost & I just couldn't get my head around Liz as a character or her supposed motivations. OK she comes out of the situation like some sort of genius who plays the system & the scared little girl routine perfectly but would anyone really have caused all that suffering & hurt which eventually leads to your best friend dying just so some bloke would notice them? I have a fantastic friend named Kelly & I know for a fact I wouldn't be able to sit by & watch her in pain slowly dying no matter what the reason & I find it hard to believe anyone could do what Liz does to someone they care for, it would kill me to see Kelly or anyone I like suffer for ANY reason. Anyway, despite not being able to get my head around this aspect of The Hole that well I still think it's good entertainment, it's different, it's memorable & I liked it a fair bit.<br /><br />Director Hamm does a good job, he doesn't seem to go for out-and-out scares but the film has a nice atmosphere to it. He keeps the pace going while maintaining the mystery elements of the plot so as to keep you guessing, for such a simple idea it all works rather well in my opinion. There's not much in the way of gore or violence, there's a disgusting toilet crawling with maggot's but that's as gross as it gets.<br /><br />According tot he IMDb The Hole had an estimated budget of £4,158,370 which sounds a very odd figure to just be an 'estimate'. Anyway, I'm a bit surprised because that actually sounds like quite a lot of money to me at almost $8,000,000 & considering there's no big name actors, no special effects, only two or three locations & functional rather than spectacular production design it seems a lot. Shot entirely in England. The acting was good, there were one or two moments where it might have been better but for a largely unknown cast they did OK.<br /><br />The Hole is an effective little thriller that I thought was well worth watching although probably not more than once. I liked it, it ain't perfect by any means but it's something a bit different, it definitely gets a recommendation from me.\",\n",
       " \"This film is a heavy one. The acting is intense and the suspense carries through the whole movie. As Kiera Knightly's first leading role, I must say it goes against the glam sexy characters she so often chooses now. Thora Birch is also noteworthy although her British accent is inconsistent at the best of times. On the whole it was too intense for me, but I guess that just shows that it pulls no punches. The scenes with the trapped teenagers succeed in conveying a sense of claustrophobia and panic leading to despair. Some scenes actually made me a bit nauseous. Daring undertaking for the young cast and shows that monsters, cheap shot scares and gratuitous special effects are not necessary to scare you. I don't think I could watch this again.\",\n",

That was one of the sickest things I've seen in a long time. The thing about it though was it was scary, just not supernaturally scary. It was psychological and not macabre. I didn't feel scared afterward; let's just say I'll be a little more careful about my friends from now on. Thora Birch was a grade a psycho. I thought the girl looked like Keira Knightley, I had no idea though.<br /><br />It was playing on one of the movie channels and I got bored so I decided to watch it. That choice has probably changed me. It was an excellent movie. I'm currently trying to find it on DVD\",\n",

I\\'d never heard anything about it, and like most blind rentals, expected it to be very mediocre at best - I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised...<br /><br />The story centers around a group of kids at a high-class boarding school. The school is going on a field-trip, and anyone that doesn\\'t want to go has to go back home for the duration of the trip. A group of four students are looking for a way out, and with the help of another student, hole-up (so to speak...) in an abandoned bunker. It all starts off as fun-and-games, until no one comes back to retrieve them. With the bunker locked from the outside, the group has no way out, and the tension builds as supplies run out and the \"fun\" comes to an end...<br /><br />I thought this film was pretty dead-on in every sense. The casting and acting were great, the transition within the bunker from a fun party-place to a death-trap is palpable, and the story has some pretty inventive twists that I didn\\'t see coming. I highly recommend this one for horror or thriller fans who want something a little different from the average slasher/zombie/alien/serial-killer, etc...types of films. 8.5/10',\n",

It was well acted, though to be honest I didn't think Kiera Knightley was that amazing in it, especially since she wasn't in it all the way through. And I do not understand it in the slightest when people say she stole the film from Thora Birch. The one, and only, problem with this film is that, as a very very religious person, the excessive nudity and fondling was a problem. And the blood was unnecessary, but it's Hollywood (or wherever this film was made), and I had low expectations. Great film though, love it to bits, one of my faves ever.\",\n",
       " \"Scenario and story: The story evolves around 4 teenagers skipping school camp and admitting themselves to be locked up in a hole for 3 days voluntarily. What 3 of the 4 don't know, is that one of them has planned all of this: a friend (Martyn) of hers (Liz) came up with the idea of the hole to be locked up with the guy (Mike) she loves for those 3 days.<br /><br />It's slow upfront but when the first person ('Franky', Frances) dies of starvation because the girl is on an extreme diet, the movie gets intense. As not to give everything away, I won't tell the rest of the story: suffice to say Liz' cunning plan doesn't work out completely like she planned it...<br /><br />Acting and directing: The acting by the four teenagers is very good: both the school part as the hole part. Especially Thora Birch as Liz: the cool but always plotting girl who's desperately in love with a guy. When she finds this love not answered, she get's even colder. The psychologist (Dr. Philippa Horwood) who has been trying to get the horror stuff out of Liz through therapy does a good job too, as a sort of narrative point without narrating anything.<br /><br />Audio and cinematography Nothing wrong with the music and sound effects: it all adds greatly to the eerie and weird atmosphere: not too cheesy, not too light, just right. Cinematography is great as well: very good use of environment, lighting and colour. No errors, no odd stuff.<br /><br />Conclusion In the end, the movie is very good, but still misses something, and that mostly is for the storytelling/development account. The whole point of the movie is the love of Liz for Mike, and that has not been worked out enough in the movie. 7 out of 10 from me.\",\n",

I was wrong. It actually deserves much more attention than those. The acting was quite good unlike most teen flicks and Thora Birch (the little girl from `Patriot Games') was excellent, she succeeds in carrying the movie alone. The plot is quite complex and gruesome and the director managed to shoot some scenes with a lot of cleverness which brings about nerve racking situations and very tense moments. The film starts a bit slow with some pointless scenes but it got better and better as it went along. The last scene is extremely well shot and acted, there's no dialogue actually just gazes and stares but it's so well acted and done that we are able to guess exactly what's going on in the characters' minds. In addition to this, the score suits perfectly to what's happening on the screen. I give it an 8 but it could well deserve a 9 in comparison to other teen horror flicks. It looks like a nasty version of Big Brother (there is even a shrink !) but unlike Big Brother the film is entertaining, very impressive and worth watching although the twist is plainfully obvious.

But unfortunately it fails.<br /><br />The director just fails to deliver the tension the movie starts with. It keeps you guessing what really happened but as soon as you begin to see what the true events were, the movie fails to be a horror movie. The events are displayed without any dark atmosphere and although the idea of what happened is scary (I wouldn\\'t want to give away the ending) it appears just plain.<br /><br /> However I thought the acting was great, which pretty much saves the rest of the movie. Liz Dunn (playing Thora Birch) gives as a great performance if you ignore her terrible accent, from her great scream at the beginning to her \"evil\" look in the final scene.<br /><br />If you ignore \"some\" of the flaws in the script it still comes out a pretty good psychological horror movie.',\n",

       " 'I have been after this movie for years. If you like learning about other cultures, predominantly Indian tribes, or if are an environmentalist or ecologist, you will love the movie. Also, any parent will feel for the main characters. It is truly touching how the family never gives up looking for their lost son, and risk everything for that cause. It is true that the ending is unexpected, but it shows the intentions of the father were to give up his dream to give his son and new life a chance to survive in the Amazon. There is light nudity for the children, but it is convincingly part of the story line. I will share this movie with my eleven year old environmentalist as soon as I can get it.',\n",
       " 'This movie supposedly sends an environmental message, and that\\'s certainly true, but if you look closely it\\'s really a fig leaf (like one of those little flaps on a string that constitute the sole bit of clothing worn by the villagers) for an updated Tarzan movie.<br /><br />That said, this movie is tremendous entertainment. It is exciting almost all the way through. And when it\\'s slow, there are lots of cute teenage girls in the altogether to gaze at. In fact, there\\'s a demographically striking abundance of teenage girls in this particular tribe.<br /><br />Favorite scene: During the courtship ritual, Tomme is given a club and is supposed \"knock out\" his girl in front of the villagers and then carry her off into the forest. She cowers. He hesitates, waves the club around. She glares at him and whispers, \"Do it right!\" So he hits her and she makes a show of being \"knocked out.\" The whole courtship ritual is beautifully staged. I cannot attest to its authenticity, but it\\'s perfectly clear as he \"defends\" her from menacing dudes, refuses to be carried off by the other girls, etc. The sheer enthusiasm portrayed is remarkable.<br /><br />Powers Boothe, playing a dam engineer, makes a dashing Trader Horn-type. He has a great scene when he wakes up in the village only to see his son, Tomme, sleeping peaceful and embracing his girl, both practically nude in the next hammock. The expressions that run across his face are priceless.<br /><br />The Fierce People live up to their name, but I am dubious that people who live in nature can be so infected with violence.<br /><br />I learned something. You can climb a high-rise by wrapping vines around your feet. Who knew? The dam business at the end was totally righteous, but, really, pretty preposterous.<br /><br />And how about that shot of the eagle in flight. Taken from about two feet away. Pretty neat.<br /><br />Terrific Hollywood movie? You bet. Werner Herzog? Not so much.',\n",
       " 'Emerald Forest is certainly guilty of oversimplifying the displacement of tribal peoples, but I remembered it fondly. I watched it on video, soon after it came out, and again this morning. I found that I had long since forgotten all the flashy aspects of the plot (the cannibals, the machine gun and the sex slavers), but remembered the courtship ritual very clearly. The parts I had forgotten seemed a bit forced, harder to believe.<br /><br />After my first viewing, I was certain that \"Daddee\" Bill had blown up the dam. Now I\\'m not so sure it wasn\\'t coming down anyway.<br /><br />Also, it was hard not to be reminded of Jungle2Jungle (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119432/) while watching it now, especially where the son mystically finds his father\\'s skyscraper apartment in a large city.',\n",
       " 'Tommy is taken from his family by an Amazon tribe called \"The Invisible Ones\" and father Bill spends ten years searching for him. After finding a few leads, he has an encounter with a dangerous cannibal tribe called \"The Fierce Ones\" and actually stumbles on his son as he tries to flee for his life. The dilemma of the piece comes with a decision left up to Tommy, leave his tribe which are essentially his real family after ten years of living with them or joining his father in the modern civilization across the river.<br /><br />The film is more a focus on how modernization, progress if you will, has began to wipe out the trees and land of Amazon tribes as they slowly die out. Interesting enough is that Bill is a model example of this type of progress as he heads a log dam which clears land once civilized by The Fierce Ones tribe. He will spend time with The Invisible Ones tribe and find the error of his ways seeing that what he and others(White Man)are doing to people who have lived here for centuries destroying cultures. We also see how the ugliness of prostitution has became a stigma to tribes as The Fierce Ones trade women from The Invisible Ones tribe for machine guns. Using the machine guns, The Fierced Ones have a clear advantage over The Invisible Ones and their mere spears. Again, through that we see how progress can also destroy a civilization..The Fierce Ones can wipe out who they deem a threat and/or nuisance with advanced weaponry.<br /><br />When The Invisible Ones lose a great deal of their men to those machine gun attacks, Tomme(his name amongst his tribe)will search for his father across the river for help to get back their women who have been traded to a prostitution house.<br /><br />Stunning cinematography(by Philippe Rousselot)and score are highlights of this amazingly shot film set in the Amazon. Through Boorman\\'s fluid camera-work, we follow the characters as they travel to destinations in the immense forest, yet see what is happening as modernization is chopping away the trees that once populated said Amazon forest. I thought the angle of the modern age clashing with tribal customs in the form of Tommy to be the strong point of the film while the progress part of the film as it pertains to the cultures being wiped out laid on a bit too thick. I didn\\'t quite like the remaining twenty minutes(the deal with the prostitution ring resulting in heavy violence and the whole rain ordeal as it destroys the dam) as much as the first hour as Powers Booth\\'s Bill was amongst a culture of people he knew nothing about. Seeing his son almost completely tribal is interesting not to mention the viewer getting a glimpse into a unique culture of people and their ways of living. The mythological aspects were also diverting from the realism of the film(if a wee bit silly).<br /><br />Young Charley Boorman is quite impressive as Tomme.',\n",
       " \"Are you serious? The customs are based LOOSELY on real customs to become some bastardized mish-mash. The director went and lived for a short while with the Xingu tribe in the amazon. What does that mean? It means he saw them through the eyes of an outsider not as someone part of the culture. All what you see is his interpretation of what Xingu culture is: the taking of hallucinogens, marriage, women's dances, jagua painting and others. This does not even come close to true Xingu culture. (Btw I love how the tribes were really good African and modern dancers.) This is just the magical-childlike-Indian stereotype set in the Amazon.\",\n",

On the one hand it's a good looking and also clearly professionally made movie with lots of talent involved but it just makes some wrong choices in its storytelling.<br /><br />The movie obviously starts of as a dramatic 'based on true' events movie but soon as the movie starts to progresses it starts taking some obvious 'Hollywood' turns, with its emotions and action and the story becomes more unlikely and clichéd. Of course nothing wrong with this, since it definitely makes the movie an entertaining and bit of adventurous one. But in this case the approach doesn't really work out, since it also obviously is a movie that wants to be taken seriously and has a clear message in it. You know, the kind of message to 'save the rain forest'. It also uses lots of technology vs. nature elements. I'll admit that this movie is a better attempt than all Steven Seagal attempts combined but no, that doesn't mean that this movie is a perfect or truly successful attempt on its own. The movie seems to lack the proper emotions to see this as a completely effective one, though the right intentions are definitely there. I mean for instance, the characters within this movie see each other again for the first time in 10 years but yet they seem hardly affected by it all.<br /><br />The natives scenes also aren't always among the best or most interesting one's out of the movie. Sure the nature environments are beautiful looking but it slows the movie a bit down in the middle, which also is in big contrast with the serious and dramatic first part of the movie and the action filled final part. The entire movie doesn't always feel like one whole. The parts of it are all too disjointed.<br /><br />It nevertheless it is a rather good- and also entertaining enough movie to watch, despite its obvious flaws and bad choices in the storytelling.

Why?<br /><br />It contains action, drama and has somewhere I think a conscience, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />Mr Boorman is such a talented filmmaker who every time somethings bordering on getting personal, might it be action or drama or feelings in general, put a little distance between the audience and the camera again. Its not much, hardly noticeable.<br /><br />What is does however is that it render the movie tones of reality, tiny pieces of documentary that somehow also makes it a powerful statement without indulging in pointers. Still its no lame movie. It just has nuances<br /><br />This might be seen as total contrast to many Hollywood action movies, who instead indulge themselves in personal feelings of the protagonists, and even heighten them technically, in order to manipulate the audience to co-feeling. We as an audience are relieved of the responsibility of our feelings, somewhat.<br /><br />Mr Boorman leaves us with a choice.<br /><br />Something about the story then: An American architect works in south America, on the border of the Amazon, One day his young son is kidnapped by indians....cant tell you more.

Ten years later, after an expedition in which he is captured by cannibals, the father is finally reunited with the son, who has been raised by the savages and knows no other way of life.<br /><br />This is a pretty unique picture, even if the roots of the story obviously come from Tarzan, because it manages to be three things at once; an exciting jungle action flick, an intimate family drama and a sobering environmental message movie. It manages to achieve this I think partly because of the excellent script by Rospo Pallenberg, and partly because there are no big-shot movie stars in the cast looking ridiculous in the jungle. Boothe and Foster are both terrific and virtually everyone else is an authentic-looking non-actor (Polonah in particular, as Wanadi, the Chief of the Invisible People and Tommy's surrogate father, is superb). The casting of the director's son in the pivotal role is a bit ethically shaky, but the younger Boorman is not only ideal for the role (his almost-too-good-looking features and brilliant blonde locks contrast perfectly with the tribespeople) but he delivers a carefully measured performance of confident innocence. The heartachingly beautiful locations, the rich detail of the Invisible People's customs and a terrific electro-ethnic score by Junior Homrich all add tremendous atmosphere to an extremely original and captivating film. A jungle adventure not to be missed.\",\n",

For what I know, the Gilgamesh poem already dealt with this subject, and it was written quite a few years ago. We are very clever, very civilized, advanced human beings, but maybe we are not improving. Maybe we are not progressing, but we are declining.

The underlying theme is pretty standard tree-hugger stuff; evil, rapacious white men destroying the Garden of Eden and dispossessing the innocent, noble savages along the way. The film claims to be based on a true story, but I'd take that with very large pinch of salt. If indeed it was based on true events then the producer/director has been a bit careless with the some of the facts. The Amazon basin is an enormously hostile environment, just about every critter, bug and bacterium that likes to eat people lives there. Amongst the native Indian tribes, that still live there, the infant mortality rate is something like about 80% and adults who live much past 40 years are rarities. Needless to say that's not the way the place is portrayed in the film. Certainly not cinema verite.\",\n",

Part of me admires it for its hard edged eco message coupled with its violent action packed adventure elements while part of me hates it for its convienent mystical mumbo jumbo when the script requires Tomme and the invisible people to escape from a tight spot . Is it an action adventure or is it a mystical fantasy ? It`s both and it`s neither if you know what I mean .<br /><br />Hold on , it`s an admirable film despite the flaws , in many ways THE EMARALD FOREST is the type of film Steven Seagal would have made if he had any talent , it`s a film that doesn`t talk down to the audience unlike nearly every eco-thriller made and does make the point that when everyone you love and everything you survey is in mortal peril then violence is the only way you can defend yourself .

This could have been an intelligent and moving film about a man who finds his missing son after 10 years adopted by a native tribe in the amazon. But the stuff about the tribe being mystical and in touch with nature is layed on a little too thick. This \"noble savage\" cliche just substitutes one stereotype for another. And the climactic scene in the brothel was ill-concieved, not to mention the silly Deus Ex Machina ending involving the dam, making the Rain ending in \"Dune\" seem plausible by comparison. It seems tacked on and lessens the ecological message Boorman was driving home.',\n",

       " 'Bill Markham, Powers Boothe (U-Turn, Nixon) is an engineer who moved to Brazil to develop a water dam in the Amazon Jungle. After a day in the woods on a picnic with his family, his son Tommy, innocently started watching ants and walked into the jungle. The \"Invisible People,\" native Brazilian Indians that colored their faces so well that it blended with the trees and the habitat in general, took Tommy with them. The son just disappeared in the jungle. After a search the parents could not find the boy. Tommy grows up raised by the Indians and adjusts to their culture and customs and is called Tomme. Tomme is a happy native now. There is a book about the making of Emerald Forest, an international endeavor. The book tells about the difficulties in making a movie in the Amazon jungle, because of the environmentalists, and the bureaucracy. The director, John Boorman (Hell in the Pacific) was determined that his son, Charley Boorman (Hope and Glory), would not play Tomme, but he could not find anyone else to play Tomme and his son ends up with the part. The movie gives a lot of insight in the native Brazilian Indians. Tomme dreams about his father Bill Markham. When Tomme is a young adult, about to be married to young native, he runs into his father, who is still searching for him. This is a very poignant and moving moment in this movie. Tomme recognizes him and trusts him because he is the \"man in his dreams\" whom he calls Dada. Markham wants his son to go back to the white man\\'s \"Civilization,\" but Tomme is now a native and no longer fits in that civilization, no matter how civilized it is. Tomme goes visiting the apartment complex where the parents lived when another tribe armed by white men stole his tribe\\'s women. He had started remembering things. He sees the place where he lived during a trace in which he becomes his guardian spirit, a Harpy eagle. Instead of taking the elevator, he climbs to the top floor balcony on the outside of the building! He had become one of the best warriors in the tribe, but the other tribe has guns. When Tomme goes into the \"white man civilization,\" there is evil: drinkers, rape, abuse to the native Indians, and all the unfairness that is common to the natives around the world. Tomme lived in a very innocent environment where the natives lived as any society lives. Tomme is happy there. It is absolutely impossible to bring him out from the culture he now knows. Tomme is married to a beautiful native and is happy! The father now realizes what civilization is doing to the Amazon forest and finally destroys the dam that threatened the life of the natives. Now he had a reason: the happiness of his own son depends on it. The father is now against the development that he was hired to accomplish. The cinematography is beautiful. The natives to our surprise were actors. Boorman refused to use natives in the movie for fear of corrupting them. The actors did such a great job that we thought they were real natives. There are beautiful moments of tenderness between the natives and Tomme. It is a bitter sweet story because Markham could never make his son happier than he already was, and lost forever chance of knowing his son and making him happy. My favorite scenes: the son in the water fall discovering his own sexuality with a group of female natives, where a son and father meet, the dances of the natives. There was a lot of work involved in this movie.',\n",
       " 'The Emerald Forest is a racist, oversimplification of a more complex issue. The portrayal of Native Americans is a joke and perpetuates stereotype after stereotype of native \"innocence\" vs. Western \"intelligence\". The portrayal of the Fierce People as cannibalistic baboons is ridiculous and highly offensive - especially under the claim that the film is based on true events. Equally as unfortunate is the display of the Invisible People as a tribe of purity and peace - their \"beautiful\" innocence makes them the pathetic victim of Western expansion. Obviously, this movie addresses an important topic, but their are better ways to make the argument against deforestation and genocide. This movie is best used as a metaphor for understanding of the story of Adam and Eve and Christian morality. Outrageously bad acting to top it off - it\\'s good for a laugh.',\n",

It\\'s like the writers thought to themselves, \"Hmm, wow I blew all our money on cocaine and I still don\\'t have an ending. I bet a happy ending would sell well.\" It even ended with the words on the screen saying \"A few tribe still have not made contact with the outside world. They remember something we forgot.\" How stupid and cheesy is that?

       " \"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Little more, really, than a '70s exploitation flick, Sweet Kill (a.k.a. The Arousers) has a few points of interest beyond its plenitude of bared breasts and buttocks. First of all, it marks the very early directing and screenwriting debut of Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential, 8 Mile). Beginning in the 1960s, many of them in Roger Corman's raffish moviemaking academy, a number of directors who would later achieve prominence made their bones in horror schlock and soft-core porn; Hanson would wait until the '80s to do his next film.<br /><br />Second, its star is Tab Hunter, who's the best thing in it. Plainly, he had more talent than his dispiriting filmography and his reputation as a 60s-beefcake golden boy (and worse) might lead one to believe. Here he's a high-school gym teacher (this doesn't lead to much, and his buttocks stay chastely sheathed) living in Venice, California. He has a big problem, though. Owing to some cloudily referenced incident in his boyhood (which seems to involve Oedipal incest), he can't get it up. His rage and humiliation lead him down a dark path. When a girl he's picked up turns aggressive after his failure, he kicks her away. As happens with such kicks, she conks her head and dies. He hides the body away in a pigeon hutch on his apartment rooftop. And from then on it seems he can function only with a fresh corpse. When attempts at normalcy prove futile (he pays a hooker to dress up, presumably as his mother, and lie immobile), he prowls the beaches with his butcher knife...<br /><br />And that's about it. The movie's cheapness is often evident in its sound levels, which veer erratically. The `thriller' angle isn't worked out, and the movie ends with a shot of Hunter à la Norman Bates in Psycho (homages to Hitchcock abound). Its most noteworthy feature is the empathy it shows for the murderer, a victim of circumstances which he cannot surmount.<br /><br />\",\n",
       " 'Careers in the movies on occasion take unexpected routes It is highly unlikely that anyone watching \"The Arousers\" would have guessed that it\\'s director and writer Curtis Hanson would one day join the ranks of Hollywood\\'s A list. The direction shows little flair, (to be kind), while the screenplay virtually non existent.<br /><br />Tab Hunter, the golden boy of Warner Brothers of the fifties, plunged towards obscurity after leaving the studios who had found a new hopeful in the form of Troy Donahue. They had no belief in his acting ability and solely utilized his legendary looks as bait for the burgeoning and lucrative teen audiences of the time. This, despite the fact that with each movie he seemed to be developing as an actor with definite potential. I recently watched an unremarkable early movie of his \"Lafayette Escradille\" featuring in a very minor role with hardly any lines at all, a nondescript young actor by the name of Clint Eastwood - unexpected routes indeed.<br /><br />Despite the thin material and weak supporting players (other than one Nadyne Turney), Hunter turns in a remarkably astute performance. In the light of his coming out as a gay man, there is an added poignancy in his playing a character who is impervious to the charms of the numerous sexy females who throw themselves on him. While the reasons for his psychopathic behavior do not stem from latent homosexuality but rather some extremely half baked mention of his mother, perhaps Hanson utilized something of Hunter\\'s sexuality in casting him in this role.<br /><br />There really is no reason to search this one out unless you have some interest in the varied careers of Hanson or Hunter. Others may steer clear.',\n",

Eddie viciously murders any lovely young lass who tries (and fails) to turn him on. Writer/director Curtis Hanson, who went on to win an Oscar for the terrific \"L.A. Confidential,\" does an expert job of creating and sustaining a creepy, clammy, clinical tone for this luridly compelling portrait of homicidal madness and seething misogyny. Moreover, Hanson astutely nails the whole right-on groovy swingin\\' 70\\'s zeitgeist, evokes a highly credible sense of everyday mundane reality and builds plenty of nerve-wracking tension which reaches a harrowing fever pitch in the terrifying final third. The abundant gratuitous distaff nudity, the seedy seaside Venice, California locations, the shockingly blunt\\'n\\'brutal violence and the profoundly unnerving conclusion all give this picture a raw, sleazy, unsettling edge that\\'s mighty tough to shake. Nice supporting performances by Nadyne Turney as fed-up, long-suffering unhappy single gal Barbara, Isabel Jewell as a snoopy landlady, a pre-\"Phantasm\" Angus Scrimm as Jewell\\'s husband, and longtime favorite 70\\'s drive-in flick starlet Roberta Collins as a brassy call girl. Charles Bernstein\\'s supremely spooky\\'n\\'shuddery score and Daniel Lacambre\\'s crisp, polished cinematography are both up to par. The inspired casting of Tab Hunter in the warped lead qualifies as the film\\'s masterstroke; Hunter\\'s blandly handsome boy next door persona makes for the perfect front for the severe dementia bubbling just underneath the surface.

       " 'Former 1950s teen heartthrob Tab Hunter, still looking very handsome here in his early 40s, stars as Eddie, an outwardly respectable high school phys ed teacher who is tormented by both his impotence and some childhood trauma involving his mother (which is left obscured by the filmmakers). Because of his good looks and friendly demeanor, Eddie seems to attract all sorts of neighborhood women; many of whom are young and beautiful. Unable to make love to them or become intimate enough with them on a non-sexual basis to open up to them about his past, he simply murders them. Triggering this behavior though is the accidental killing of a young woman who gets a little too aggressive and dies after Eddie pushes her off and she hits her head on a table. He hides the body in some hatch on the roof and afterward something snaps inside of him and he moves beyond the stage of repression and voyeurism to full blown murder, as well as necrophilia (which is handled with some subtlety here); apparently the only way he can \\'get off.\\' Might explain why he\\'s been paying a local hooker (played by 70s drive-in favorite Roberta Collins) to dress up like his long gone momma and \"play dead\" while he undresses and gropes her. Seems like pretty seedy stuff, and this is pretty seedy stuff; but it\\'s done with more thought and care than many others in this genre and I liked it.<br /><br />Despite what some of the reviews here state, I actually prefer the way the filmmakers decided to handle all this. Instead of a bunch of heavy-handed dialogue blatantly spelling everything out, giving a direct explanation to Eddie\\'s behavior or visualizing of all Eddie\\'s dirty deeds, we get more suggestion than anything else. The opening scene is a childhood flashback of a woman stripping naked, taking off her earrings and lying down in bed while a pair of kids tennis shoes are visible behind a barely opened curtain. That\\'s the only real glimpse we get of Eddie\\'s childhood, but it\\'s enough to raise a few questions. Is his mother a whore/prostitute? Has Eddie always been voyeuristic and/or not right in the head? Was there incest involved? Nothing is explained in a cut-and-dry way, but we know that Eddie refuses to talk about any of it, even when directly confronted about it by the one woman in this film who does care about him. That person is Barbara (Nadyne Turney), who lives in the same apartment house as Eddie. She\\'s not quite the looker the other women in this movie are, but is patient and wants to help Eddie. He\\'s gone on quite a few dates with her but nothing even remotely sexual has happened between them. Barbara questions why and wonders whether he\\'s not attracted to her or if something else is going on.<br /><br />Originally titled SWEET KILL and actually filmed in 1970, the title was later changed to the more exploitative-sounding THE AROUSERS (with a new poster to match) a few years later. There are several instances of nudity that seem needlessly tacked on, and I see here in the trivia section that executive producer Roger Corman had the director go back and film these scenes so the film could be sold on the drive-in circuit as a sex film. Though unnecessary, I didn\\'t feel these newly-added scenes (which are brief) were too detrimental to the overall film and they tried to tie them into the \\'voyeuristic\\' aspect the best they could.<br /><br />It\\'s obvious what would attract former teen idol Hunter to this kind of role - THE AROUSERS was an opportunity to branch out, possibly open up new opportunities for himself as an older actor, and also a chance to prove he could handle heavier drama. In any case, he does an effective job in his part and is well-supported by Turney (who\\'s very good here) and the rest of the cast. Popping up here in smaller roles are veteran actress Isabel Jewell (in her final role) as his landlady, as well as future horror star Angus \"Tall Man\" Scrimm (billed as \"Rory Guy\") as her husband. Neither have much to do other than complain about some awful smell coming from upstairs... The lesser-known cast members also did a fairly good job in my opinion.',\n",
       " 'From the director of the better known \"Alla Ricerca del Piacere\" (aka \"Amuck!\") comes this stylish thriller that involves not only a confusing web of love affairs and relationships, but also - towards the climax - a bundle of twists that are guaranteed to surprise every viewer without becoming implausible at any moment.<br /><br />And this is the big plus of this movie: The twists all work. The first half moves on relatively slow (similar to Silvio Amadio\\'s above mentioned earlier Giallo), but the viewer already gets enough information to know that the plot isn\\'t as simple as it seems. In the second half the film becomes a roller coaster ride of red herrings, plot twists and other surprises, which makes it decisively superior to Amadio\\'s earlier effort.<br /><br />The acting is also thoroughly convincing, which is especially important once the film is finished and the viewer gets the whole story. But the most remarkable thing in this intriguing Giallo is the lush, ear-catching main theme that will never let one go after being heard for the first time.',\n",
       " \"Judging by the plot and the fact that it's directed by Silvio Amandio, I feared that this Giallo would be a lot like the director's earlier success 'Amuck!', but despite similarities between the pair; Smile Before Death is a lot more than merely a retread of the earlier work. This film adheres more closely to the Giallo tradition of stylish and bloody murders than the earlier movie, but still finds time to ensure that the plot always revolves around the central situation. In fact, it's a miracle that Amandio has managed to keep his script from becoming a complete mess; as aside from this new flair for murders, and the central situation; Smile Before Death is also a twisty little thriller, which manages to pull several things out of the hat before boiling down to a superb and unexpected conclusion. The plot follows the death of a woman named Dorothy. The police declare it suicide, but it's not long before Dorothy's daughter, Nancy, makes her way to her mother's house; where she meets the seductive Gena and her stepfather, Marco. However, things turn sinister when the housekeeper divulges some information that means Dorothy's death may not have been suicide...<br /><br />The film starts off slowly, and aside from some lush photography that makes good use of its female leads, the film doesn't really commence until the half way point. Amandio keeps the tension bubbling throughout, and sex is always at the forefront of the action. Roberto Pregadio provides a suitable catchy jingle, which accompanies nearly every scene in the movie. The tune is typically Italian, and fits the movie well; but I'd have preferred it if it was played a bit less often, as it soon starts to get old, and the overall impact is lessened. The movie benefits, as Amuck did, from a great leading performance from Rosalba Neri, who is joined by the stunning Luciana Della Robbia. The pair doesn't share any scenes together that are as great as those between Neri and Barbara Bouchet in Amuck, but Silvio Amandio obviously enjoys filming lesbian scenes; and when they're this good, I enjoy watching them! The film is rounded off by an isolated atmosphere, which provides a pressure cooker for the lead characters to roast in. This is a rare Giallo in that, by the conclusion, most aspects of it make sense and while Smile Before Death is hard to track down, I recommend making the effort!\",\n",
       " \"16-year-old boarding school student Nancy (Jenny Tamburi) arrives in town after her mother commits suicide. She is taken in by her stepfather Marco (Silvano Tranquilli), who has already moved in his mistress Gianna (Rosalba Neri). Things get a bit strange when Nancy begins to suspect her mother didn't commit suicide and puts the moves on both of her hosts. This is a nifty little thriller from Silvio (AMUCK!) Amadio with enough twists and turns to keep you interested. The main mystery isn't too hard to guess, but there is a nice extra twist at the end and, of course, another one for good measure. Tamburi and the gorgeous Neri spend a lot of their screen time nude and that certainly helps too. Quite possibly the best thing about the film is a theme that is so catchy with Amadio using it at every opportunity. You will definitely be humming it for days after watching this one.\",\n",
       " 'When her estranged(..and very rich)mother dies(..ruled a suicide, though it\\'s obviously not), teenage Nancy(Jenny Tamburi, twenty at the time, but succeeds in her portrayal of a coquettish Lolita-type of teenage girl who might not be the dense, naive simpleton they at first suspect)returns home from years of various boarding schools to enjoy life on the wilder side, living with lothario step-dad Marco(..the handsome Silvano Tranquilli)and successful photographer Gianna(..the sensual Rosalba Neri, so divine you can\\'t take your eyes off of her). Gianna was given carte blanche by Nancy\\'s mother Dorothy to live in her own place while operating a studio on the estate. Gianna was also Marco\\'s lover, and the two scheme to murder Nancy because when she \"comes of age\", the inheritance is hers. But, instead Nancy begins to seduce them, while also turning Gianna and Marco against each other through cunning manipulation..but, while quite drawn to Nancy, neither actually ever trusts her.<br /><br />Boy, this is quite a trio we watch throughout the film. You always wonder what might happen next despite the fact that writer-director Silvio Amadio lays the cards out on the table midway through regarding how Dorothy was killed, detailed how it was accomplished, letting us know that Nancy might be in grave danger because the murder was so well orchestrated. Yet, you always(..or, at least I did)wonder what Nancy has up her sleeve. Late into the film, Marco discovers Nancy chatting with someone at a horse race which plants a seed of curiosity regarding her own possible agenda. The film is slick under Amadio\\'s direction and he casts doubt on all three characters. To chose, Nancy seems to be the one we sympathize with as Marco and Gianna plot about the proper method of execution.<br /><br />My favorite aspect is the homo-eroticism between Gianna and Nancy. Through Neri\\'s performance(..she commands your attention in a minimalist fashion), we can see Gianna\\'s attraction to Nancy right away, and as the film continues, that infatuation grows(..especially after photographing her nude or barely clothed)..it\\'s all in her eyes, this lust that begins to take hold. Also racy is Nancy\\'s seduction of the much older Marco, his resistance of her not contained very long. But, most of all, the twists at the end. The fate of all who desire the deceased Dorothy\\'s money, along with multiple double crosses, and the downfall of an ingenious plot(s), not to mention the ultimate irony as the screen fades black, certainly make SMILE BEFORE DEATH quite a giallo worth seeking out if you can find a copy. It deserves a legitimate DVD release, a giallo I\\'m sure fans would be interested in.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve pretty much seen all the classics as well as the hidden gems of the Italian sub genre of Giallo, so what remains now are the more obscure and undiscovered gems \\x85 If I\\'m lucky, at least. \"Smile before Death\" is such a film Giallo connoisseurs have certainly heard about already, but the film remains unavailable on DVD to this day and if you really want to see it you have to be satisfied with a computer ripped bootleg version with poor picture quality and unidentifiable foreign subtitles. \"Smile before Death\" is not bad, but certainly not great neither (otherwise it would be wider known by now, ha!) This isn\\'t exactly what I would call the most exciting Giallo ever made. It opens promisingly enough, with the murder of a middle-aged woman in a remote country estate. The bedroom door was locked from the inside when they found the body and her throat was slit with a piece of glass that was found in her hand, so the police close the case as suicide. The teenage daughter Nancy comes to the estate and befriends her mother\\'s best friend, a photographer, as well as her handsome lover. The initially shy Nancy is quickly drawn into the sleazy world of nude modeling and the sexual affection of mature men. She doesn\\'t know, however, that the clue to solving her mother\\'s dead lies with these same people and that she\\'s actually an obstacle in the killer(s) complete fiendish scheme. \"Smile before Death\" a stylish but sadly dull and underwhelming mystery thriller. Apart from the murder on the mother near the beginning, which is shown repeatedly and at least three times, there\\'s nothing even remotely suspenseful going on. I remember from \"Amuck\" \\x96 the other Giallo by Silvio Amadio \\x96 that the director is more interested in the naked bodies of his lead actresses than in suspense and gruesome killing. I can\\'t say I blame him, especially when working with Rosalba Neri, but the lack of excitement here is really intolerable. The theme song is great but overused and after a while I got sick and tired of staring at the young lead actress\\' naked body. That\\'s never a good sign. Patient viewers will be rewarded with an acceptably entertaining \\x96 albeit predictable and derivative \\x96 climax, but it\\'s too late to safe the movie.

       " 'I actually know something about this film because the producer of the movie was my landlord at one point. The Psychotronic Man is a grade B movie that\\'s true, but it is actually an important and noteworthy piece mostly because of its relationship to film history and several other oddities that surround it. <br /><br />It was the first feature film made entirely in Chicago since the Essanay era before WW1. It was only able to be made after the death of Chicago\\'s longest reigning mayor, who would not allow movies to be made anywhere in Chicago. It was also an independent feature film, made entirely outside any of the existing studio systems. It was shot completely on location and it used only local talent. Many of the centrally located automobile chase scenes and running gun battles were shot on the sly without the permission of any authorities because no film commission existed. Part of the movie featured a car chase in Lower Wacker Drive which is an odd funky piece of roadway under downtown Chicago. In the next year the Blues Brothers came out and featured a car chase in the exact same place.<br /><br />It was produced, written, and starred in by an out of work actor named Peter Spelson who decided the best way to get into the movies was to go out and make one himself.<br /><br />It is however probably most noted for its name. The term \"Psychotronic\" has come to be an almost generic term for grade B cult films. Google turns up 88,600 different references for the word, all of which come as a result of this movie.<br /><br />It did well in Europe under various names but it played only once in Chicago where it was made on April, 23, 1980 at 7:00 P.M. in the now demolished Carnegie Theater.<br /><br />Like many first efforts it is crude by comparison to the things that follow it, but it is truly one the beginnings the of modern American independent movie trend.

If, for some reason, you ARE gonna be subjected to this, don't expect ANY elements of many sci-fi/horror films - no special effects; no gore; no sex - virtually no attempts. So, it's a no-no, all the way. Rigid acting; illogical continuity. The plot is simple: Rocky uses psychotronic ability to dispense with people; and the Chicago-area cops get onto his trail as a result. Psychotronic wasn't in MY dictionary, but I THINK that it means that he can WILL things to happen. I suspect that he WILLED a lot of time in his car. MY psychotronic powers must need a little work: This movie continued for quite a while after I WILLED it to end.\",\n",
       " 'Here\\'s another great contender for my own personal award of \"Most Demented Film I ever watched\", but the least I can say is that it was very interesting. \"The Pschotronic Man\" begins with the longest and most unnerving opening credits ever, but they\\'re quite sinister and atmospheric what with the really creepy music and odd color schemes and everything. This is one of them rare films that already make you feel uncomfortable before it even properly takes off. The slow-paced story introduces Rocky Foscoe; a barber with a few issues that may or may not be caused by the fact that he consumes his own hair shampoos and conditioner lotions. Rocky starts having strange visions, like himself flying around in a car and such similar tomfoolery, and he gradually becomes the world\\'s first and only Psychotronic Man. Basically, this just means that he\\'s an older, fatter and sleazier male version of \"Carrie\" who can inflict stuff only by using his overdeveloped willpower. At first, Rocky doesn\\'t comprehend the powers that have been granted to him and even seeks professional help to make the unbearable headaches go away, but then he gradually learns how to control his skills and use it against the people he doesn\\'t like, like his own wife who\\'s in the way of his love affairs. <br /><br />\"The Psychotronic Man\" is overall a pretty cool flick, but sadly director Jack M. Sell wasn\\'t quite sure which narrative tone to maintain. Does this story require a dramatic, mysterious or exploitative tone? Or perhaps a combination of all three? This indecisive behavior leads to an illogical structure and uneven pacing, for example when a moody love-making sequence is immediately followed by an extremely violent murder vision. The film is also slow and uneventful. Especially considering the plot outline, they could have made this into a far more grotesque and trashy cult experiment; even bearing in mind the budgetary restrictions. The overlong chase sequence, for example, is the least spectacular one in the history of cinema. The cars just drive in straight lines and at snail pace, without tricky maneuvers or causing flamboyant accidents. Still, there\\'s some greatness to find in this oddball production, like the creepy sound effects that are frequently repeated, including a church bell chiming and half the tune of Ennio Morricone\\'s classic music for \"Once upon a time in the West\". I bet the composer of this film was the only person who had great fun on set. <br /><br />Bizarre film, to say the least, but it did offer us the collective term for everything in cult, horror and trash cinema that is unique and indescribable.

Truly, even before the opening title graphics crawled across the screen some seven minutes (significant?) into the first reel this reviewer craved the blissful relief of an untimely death before the next zoom-in close-up of Peter Spelson\\'s heavily lidded psychotronic stare! Spelson turns in an idiosyncratic performance as Rocky Foscoe, the barber who prefers his hair tonic to Segrams Seven. Spelson\\'s Rocky is a tortured soul who has trouble putting together a simple sentence, much unlike the real-life erstwhile insurance agent turned one-time film actor who frankly has never been known to shut up! \"The Psychotronic Man\" can be favorably compared to the seminal works of Kurisawa or a young Hitchcock only if one suspends all rational thought and gives over to a delusional view of a world where a film such as this can be considered anything more than bong water worthy.<br /><br />The great news is that for the first time an exclusively authorized, digitally enhanced 2 DVD set of \"Psychotronic Man\" is now available. This new set features production stills, the handwritten screenplay and the original music score, as well as a commentary track by the Psychotronic Man Himself: Writer/Producer/Star, Peter Spelson. Also included is a short documentary on the making of \"Psychotronic Man\". Caught on tape during the shooting of this documentary is the discovery of the actual original copies of the 35mm theatrical film that were used in this digital reproduction.<br /><br />What is finally revealed in this new production is the story of Peter Spelson, a frustrated would-be film actor producing hokey late-night commercials for his own insurance agency. Peter finally concludes that if he ever wants to star in a feature film he would have to write and produce it himself. What Spelson found was a nascent Chicago film community eager to show off it\\'s chops in anticipation of John Landis and \"The Blues Brothers\" production army who came to town a year later.<br /><br />On the commentary track Spelson also tells how he begged, borrowed and sometimes appropriated with out proper authorization what he needed to complete his opus. Shooting of \"The Psychotronic Man\" went on despite the lack of any official local permits to stage car chases, fiery explosions and even late night shoot outs on Chicago\\'s Michigan Avenue!<br /><br />Featuring an insurance agent-turned-actor, a guerrilla film making style, authentic retro \\'70\\'s soundtrack and a back-story that just won\\'t die, the experience of \"The Psychotronic Man\" is truly a total greater than the sum of it\\'s parts.',\n",

       " 'ANALYZE THIS / (1999) *** <br /><br /> It has been a long time since I have seen a comic duo form a better shtick than Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal in the mob comedy \"Analyze This,\" a smart, amusing satire from director Harold Ramis (\"Multiplicity,\" \"Groundhog Day\"). For a movie like this to succeed past a commercial level, chemistry between the main characters must be amiable and spirited. Crystal and DeNiro indeed mold amiable incentive between themselves, therefore quite a few hilarious moments emerge from their perception of the well-written script by Kenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan, and Ramis himself. <br /><br />\\t\"Analyze This\" details the lives of two very different individuals. The first person is played by Billy Crystal, a calm, cool, and collected psychiatrist named Ben Sobol, who is divorced with a young teenage son and is engaged to soon wed a resigning TV reporter named Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow). Ben is currently dealing with a emotional patient (Molly Shannon) distressed because her spouse left and filed a restraining order on her. This woman\\'s problems will seem like nothing when Ben obtains his new client. <br /><br />\\tRobert DeNiro plays the second person this movie examines, the most powerful mobster in the city of New York, Paul Vitti. He and his accomplices, including a chubby and clumsy bodyguard named Jelly (Joe Viterelli), are in the process of significant business when Vitti experiences an anxiety attack. On the road to a nervous breakdown, this emotionally vulnerable man comes to Ben after Jelly briefly encounters the therapist during a minor car accident. Ben is very nervous with his new patient, who forces compliments and demands upon him. <br /><br />\\tThe first confrontation sequence between Ben and Paul is quite engaging. There is an instant odd couple chemistry among the two characters. The witty sessions Sobol and Vitti consummate are also very imaginative and smart. The scenes also have the intelligence to take Vitti\\'s emotional problems seriously. <br /><br />The setup accurately introduces both the gangsters and the psychiatrist\\'s family. We understand the mob boss\\'s feelings of stress and depression; this picture is not all shallow slapstick comedy, there is a dimensional human touch. The film takes its conflicts seriously, but executes them in a cute humorous style. The audience can also relate to Billy Crystal\\'s character, who is an average Joe with a typical American family in a complicated situation in which he is not entirely sure how to handle.<br /><br />Both external and internal conflicts are interestingly accomplished, well structured, presented, and written. The film does a good job of convincingly bringing the world of mobsters to life with well-cast actors and their rich, stylish accents. <br /><br />Paul Vitti\\'s sexual life needed more exploration; although his adulterous intentions do induce a few laughs, the story could have gone somewhere with his infidelity. Vitti\\'s family is also irresolute. The film almost never portrays them on screen and seldom does Paul himself discuss his children and wife. The Lisa Kudrow character is furthermore underwritten, never thoroughly examined and very shallow. The lack of chemistry amid Kudrow and Crystal leads to the unconvincing relationship Ben occupies. <br /><br />\\tRobert DeNiro is the perfect option for the comic role of Paul Vitti, who is a more difficult character than it may appear. DeNiro triggers a sharp comic edge and gives the right amount of exaggerated sentimentality to Vitti. Lisa Kudrow is fun to watch, producing a dim-minded character whimsically similar to the one in her hit TV sitcom \"Friends.\" Chazz Palminteri and Joe Viterelli contribute different but energetic supporting roles. <br /><br />\\t\"Analyze This\" is unmistakably the right kind of movie for Billy Crystal. I am unaware of another Hollywood comedian who could have conquered his role with more proficiency and mirth; he is one of the main components that makes \"Analyze This\" work well. Harold Ramis\\'s comedy obviously borrows ideas from past comparable films like \"Grosse Point Blank\" and \"Mafia,\" but as this production proves, just because it was done before doesn\\'t mean it cannot be successfully accomplished again with the right casting. <br /><br /> <br /><br />',\n",

He plays a mobster (familiar territory) but one who needs psychiatric help. He\\'s hilarious when he\\'s crying! His \"shrink\" is played by Billy Crystal, in an untypical low-key character role. My favorite in this film was Joe Viterelli, the fat guy-mobster who has a few very funny lines. Viterelli is one of these guys you see in a ton of gangster movies and is always interesting.<br /><br />The female lead in here, Lisa Kudrow (\"Laura\") was not appealing to me, character-wise.

When mobster Paul Vitti(De Niro) is suffering anxiety attacks for some odd reason, he sees a shrink named Ben Sobel(Crystal) to solve his tragedys and ways to move through the mob. The idea is small and it stretches out too far but its still great fun. To me this is De Niro's best comic performance of all.

       " \"Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal square off in `Analyze This,' a satirical look at `family' life from director Harold Ramis. After witnessing a hit on a colleague outside a restaurant (and narrowly escaping the same fate himself, thanks to the need of a toothpick), mob boss Paul Vitti (De Niro) finds himself overcome with panic attacks. He sweats, cries at the drop of a hat, and can't breathe. With a vital meeting only two weeks away, he realizes he needs help, quickly, and sends one of his men, Jelly (Joe Viterelli), in search of a `shrink.' Coincidentally, Jelly has just been rear-ended in traffic by Dr. Ben Sobol (Crystal), who just happens to be a psychiatrist. And Jelly has his business card. Unable to discourage the adamant Vitti, Sobol acquiesces and agrees to treat him exclusively for two weeks, though he is less than enthusiastic about being pressed into the service of a well-known criminal; even less enthused, however, is his fiancee, Laura (Lisa Kudrow). The ensuing repartee between Vitti and Sobol, served up with snappy dialogue and impeccable timing, takes this comedy, artistically and otherwise, to the highest level. De Niro and Crystal are absolutely outstanding, infusing their characters with every possible nuance, while successfully avoiding the stereotypes that lesser actors may have relied upon here. The two play so well off of one another that the humor virtually seems to explode spontaneously. All the while, the likable Kudrow more than holds her own with her co-stars, proving, unequivocally, that there is so much more to her than just being a great `Friend.' Credit must go to Ramis, as well, for keeping things on an even keel throughout. There's funny scenes aplenty in this film, especially the ones in which the loyal but somewhat thick-headed thug, Jelly, or the winsome Laura take part. The most memorable, though, is one in which Dr. Sobol dreams that he is Don Vito Corleone in the movie `The Godfather,' when he is shot while buying some fruit. This is parody at its finest. Written by Ramis, Ken Lonergan and Peter Tolan, and with a supporting cast that includes Chazz Palminteri (Primo), Richard C. Castellano (Jimmy), Kyle Sabihy (Ben's son, Michael) , Molly Shannon (Caroline) and Elizabeth Bracco (Marie Vitti), `Analyze This' will keep you laughing and `doing lines' (`You...you're good, yes, you are...yes, you are!') long after the credits have faded from the screen. I rate this one 10/10.\",\n",
       " \"I don't even know where to start. I don't want to tell you much about this film because I don't want to spoil it for you by giving you account of the funny scenes. Moreover, that would be quite impossible anyway as the film is simply funny all the way through. Sure I have my favourite scenes, one in particular, which make me laugh just thinking about them. Seriously, this is a comedy with a great story and many laughs. As a matter of fact, I really laughed all the way through, from start to finish.<br /><br />I want to recommend you to lighten up and simply relax when you decide to watch it. Let go of any expectations or judgements. Simply watch and let the movie entertain you. It might seem as an obvious thing to do but it is easy to slip into that judgemental and critical feeling however subtle it might be, which will spoil any movie for you not just this one.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie if you want to lift you spirit up for whatever reason as this movie will do it for you.

       " \"Old Bobby De Niro strolls through this film with a role he seems so comfortable with. It must surely be one of his funniest performances (ranks up there with Midnight Run), & Billy Crystal provides a cringe worthy 'tough guy' parody later on in the film. You can't help but snigger and snort at some of the dialogue which is delivered effortlessly with perfect comic timing. If you got a bad case of the blues this is certainly a film to watch. I nearly choked on my custard doughnut when De Niro's tough guy character attempts to communicate in 'Psycho Babble'. The plot revolves around counselling a 'made' mafia guy and helping him to get in touch with his true inner self leads to some hilarious and ludicrous scenes. De Niro's sidekick 'Jelly' played by Joe Viterelli, comes out with some great one liners and Lisa Kudrow doesn't do too badly out of the whole affair either playing the stable well adjusted wife to be to a tee.\",\n",

One of the best is Dr. Sobel\\'s line when he walks into his home and sees the FBI he says,\"...obsessive compulsive disorder?\" and they say \"Organized Crime Division!\" Perfect. It shows how Dr. Sobel is so \"outside\" the entire context of the lifestyle of his patient.

These two have excellent chemistry and a great supporting role by Chazz Palminteri gives the whole movie an authentic and believable feel. The best part and one of the most hilarious scenes in cinema has to be when Crystal must pose as a mobster and gives a speech at a meeting with all the five families present. And also De Niro' first visit to Crystal's has me rolling on the floor in laughter.<br /><br />Analyze This, while underrated by a lot of folks, is one of the best comedies you'll ever see. 9/10\",\n",
       " 'When you combine Robert DeNiro--our greatest actor--and Billy Crystal--one of our greatest comedians--how can you go wrong? It was a joy to see the two greats on screen together. They were absolutely magnificent and had incredible chemistry. The way their personalities conflicted with one another was a riot. Another noteworthy member in the cast is Joe Viterelli, who\\'s also a riot as DeNiro\\'s henchman Jelly. Lisa Kudrow has some funny moments and Chazz Palminteri is...CHAZZ!!! He\\'s such a cool actor that his mere appearance can make a film worthwhile. He only has a supporting role, but he\\'s great as always.<br /><br />The film has some priceless gags. Some of the best lines I\\'ve ever heard were from this movie. One that really sticks out is when DeNiro consults Crystal in the middle of the night because he couldn\\'t...get it up. Yes, it\\'s what you\\'re thinking. When Crystal advises him to take some sort of drugs to help his \"problem,\" DeNiro replies \"Drugs--I don\\'t take drugs. A hard-on should be gotten legitimately or not be gotten at all.\" Crystal replies in a dry sarcastic tone, \"I think Mark Twain said that.\" I also have to note the hilarious scene where the two guys come face to face for the first time, in Crystal\\'s office. DeNiro asks the shrink:<br /><br />\"Do you know me?\" \"Yes,\" he replies. \"No you don\\'t.\" \"No, I don\\'t.\" \"Did you see my picture in the paper?\" \"Yes.\" \"No you didn\\'t!\" \"No, I didn\\'t.\"<br /><br />And there\\'s a great interaction in which Crystal explains a theory by Sigmund Freud about a child in Greece who killed his father because he wanted to marry his mother. DeNiro quickly replies:<br /><br />\"Are you saying I wanna f**k my mother? Have you seen my mother?\" \"Well, Freud said--\" \"Well, Freud\\'s a sick f**k!\"<br /><br />There\\'s so many memorable moments, but I don\\'t want to give them all away to those who haven\\'t seen the movie. Because these are some of the funniest gags in film history. One moment--and this will be the last one I\\'ll mention--that also made me roll with laughter was the funeral sequence in which a family member got a little over-affectionate with Crystal. DeNiro replies, \"Him I don\\'t know.\"<br /><br />When I saw \"AT\" in theaters, the place was filled up and people would laugh out loud in unison--like a fifties sitcom audience--at every funny scene. That\\'s a rare occurrence, and I feel great joy whenever it actually happens. <br /><br />The comedy is not done in blatant, screwball fashion. The actors let the laughs come to them, and play it straight. Crystal has a magic way of delivering sarcastic dialogue that only people like Albert Brooks and Woody Allen can surpass. DeNiro spoofs his gangster persona without being superficial about it. He lets the audience search for the inside jokes on their own. People say DeNiro is not suited for comedy. Sure, he\\'s not the Jim Carrey-type of comic actor, but I think that\\'s what makes it work. In films like this and \"Meet the Parents\" DeNiro doesn\\'t try too hard and is never over-the-top. He expresses the comic dialogue with good timing and good delivery, without making it look like he\\'s trying to be funny. And Joe Viterelli, who\\'s been in other movies but I first discovered him on this one, is great at playing the bumbling henchman and I hope to see him more often. He has great talent. <br /><br />\"Analyze This\" is a hilarious, wildly original comedy that should have you rolling in the aisles. This is one comedy that won\\'t make you leave with guilt. You\\'re watching two great performers and the humor, though sometimes racy, is all in good taste. <br /><br />My score: 8 (out of 10)',\n",
       " 'Refreshingly doesn\\'t fall into the trap that most \"high concept\" comedies fall into: namely coasting on one good central idea and the star power of whomever gets cast in the lead role(s). This one takes a delightful, \"wish I\\'d thought of that\" premise and actually supports it with a smart, well-plotted story. Go figure. Sometimes Robert DeNiro has stretched himself too thin and hasn\\'t come off well in comedies such as WE\\'RE NO ANGELS and MAD DOG GLORY, but here his timing is virtually flawless, and his comic rapport with Billy Crystal (also excellent, as he avoids making his hapless but still dignified shrink a buffoon) is wonderful. DeNiro seems to be most at home comedically when he is spoofing his own intense, inarticulate image.<br /><br />The script is very sharp and shrewdly sidesteps the predictable whenever possible (though there is always a certain level of welcome predictability in this sort of material). There is a pivotal juncture early on where it looks as if it is going to follow the same old plot line of Crystal\\'s fiancee (nicely played by Lisa Kudrow) thinking that his sudden, unexplained disappearances to meet with the gangster must mean that he is having an affair with another woman. This movie is too intelligent for that and has too much respect for the intelligence of its characters - Crystal comes right out and explains his predicament and the rest of the film is funnier for his honesty. The viewer has more admiration for Crystal\\'s character and more belief in the couple\\'s sincere desire to be together.<br /><br />The director (and one of the writers) Harold Ramis has demonstrated once again that he is one of the best out there at light satire. This is easily one of the most consistently funny (at least a half dozen laugh out loud moments) and enjoyable comedies to come out in recent years.',\n",

The story is of a Gangster who starts to have emotional problems and panic attacks due to the death of his father 35 years ago.The ensuing antics result in a very funny and action packed cracker of a film. Dont miss it! 9 out of 10.\",\n",

It just loses appeal to fast and it especially does so after the first wedding. Then there are some shoot outs and a betrayal subplot and somehow the comedy gets lost and you just have a Mafia movie that is not really that good. Also I found the performance of Lisa Kudrow too Friends \\x96 like and I though that DeNiro could not cry that convincingly, but that latter doesn't really matter to me that much, for this is a comedy. Up until the Oedipus - joke I probably would have given this one an 8 but now seeing the whole film its this:<br /><br />A verrrrrry small (like 6,5) 7 out of 10\",\n",

The entire cast of mafia thugs is perfectly cast. Lisa Kudrow is convincing as Crystal's enduring fiancee. I haven't laughed this hard or often in a very long time. This movie was even better the second and third time around. The dialogue is the key to the chemistry in this movie. A favorite scene of mine involves De Niro's character venting his feelings on a pillow! The culminating moment came in the end, it was a very satisfying conclusion that left me in the high spirits that the movie created. Here's to another De Niro/Crystal pairing in the future! This is definitely a film worth seeing.\",\n",

       " '\"Analyze This\" is a wickedly funny tale of where a tough, foul-mouthed New York mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) suddenly loses his mind and is persuaded by Jelly (Joe Viterelli), one of his two bodyguards to go see a shrink a few weeks before a big meeting. At first, Vitti doesn\\'t like the idea, but goes ahead. The first time that Vitti and Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), a calm shrink meet face to face is okay, but the events that happen after that are serious and down-right funny. The dialogue that Crystal and De Niro are well-written and well-acted. Lisa Kudrow, Joe Viterelli, and Chazz Palminterri also give very solid supporting performances in this movie. Kyle Sahiby is good as Sobel\\'s son who has fun nitpicking Sobel. Harold Ramis has made some good films in the past (Caddyshack) and his careful direction here pays off. <br /><br /> The best scene of the movie is the opening scene is masterfully written to perfection and it\\'s just hilarous. One good example is Vitti\\'s dad and a friend of his hijack a farmer who\\'s on his John Deere tractor and drive through the corn field. Overall, De Niro and Crystal make a great comedy team.',\n",

       " \"With a story premise like this, it's really hard to do anything wrong. A mafia-boss goes to a psychiatrist. It's surprising that nobody had this idea before. I mean, it's really something new. But to be sure, they casted Robert de Niro and Billy Crystal.<br /><br />Which ways the story is in fact not really interesting. It just doesn't matter. I mean, we don't really want to know why Paul Vitti (De Niro) has so much problems and when we finally got to know it, we don't feel better.<br /><br />But these two characters themself are interesting enough to watch them one and a half hours. Crystal as a psychiatrist is fantastic. It's strange he never played one before. He reminded me a bit on Richard Dreyfuss in \\x91What About Bob?', another great psychiatrist-movie. But at least he doesn't get mad. Crystal is always a fine actor and he rarely makes a bad film. It's just too much fun to watch him. He looks always scared and neurotic and this is funny enough.<br /><br />But they couldn't had anyone better casted than De Niro. I mean, we saw him so many times as a gangster. I read a review about \\x91True Confessions' where he plays a priest, where Roger Ebert couldn't think of him in such a role. Of course today we know how much this actor can do and how much he can be called one of the greatest actors of all times. But the gangster is a role we just know him. Here he plays another gangster - and he makes fun of it. That's really great. Consider the scene where they want to torture a little guy to make them tell who betrayed them. De Niro shouts at him, takes a barr and... does nothing. He just can't. We saw him hitting guys so often, this is just unbelievable. De Niro is great and he proofed again that he can play nearly anything.<br /><br />The best scenes are the ones where Crystal and De Niro talk. The way De Niro convinces Crystal of the things he wants to hear is great. The best one is the classical first line. `Do you know me?' `Yes, I Do.' `No, you don't.' `No, I don't'<br /><br />To the rest there isn't much to say. Palminteri plays just a stereotype and I hope Kudrow will ever get a role where she plays someone intelligent. Joe Viterelli is quite enjoyable and the actor who plays Crystals son is also funny. The story is, as I said, not that much interesting. I mean, who really cares about all the betrayals and all that stuff. But they could have finished the conflict Crystal had with his father instead of just starting with it and never going anywhere.<br /><br />It's a really entertaining film with lots of good jokes. Not really a masterpiece, but a good comedy. This is an effort ourdays.<br /><br />8/10 \\\\ 3/4 \\\\ 2 (1+ - 6-)\",\n",

       " 'Because it\\'s a newer version of a classic horror movie (and it went directly to video), I have been putting off watching Stuart Gordon\\'s take on Edgar Allen Poe\\'s classic story, but after finally catching it; I can honestly say that I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t see it earlier! While the Roger Corman/Vincent Price version of the tale is far better, this update still has a lot in store for the horror fan, most notably it\\'s superb European styled atmosphere, and a fine performance by Lance Henriksen, which may even be the best of his career. While these elements are contributors to the film\\'s success, the main reason why the film works is the story behind it. Of course, it\\'s based (albeit loosely) on Poe\\'s classic tale, so the story is bound to be solid; but it doesn\\'t take all of it\\'s influence from Poe, and so Dennis Paoli can take a lot of credit for the screenplay he wrote for the movie. The idea of \\'the pendulum\\', along with a \\'pit\\' can conjure up many feelings of dread and pain, and this film adequately capitalises on that with it\\'s excellent torture filled finale! <br /><br />As mentioned, Lance Henriksen gives what is maybe his best performance in this film. He is both powerful and frightening in his role as Torquemada, the head witchfinder of the Spanish Inquisition. When he says \"I am the inquisition\", it\\'s enough to make your hairs stand on end. Henriksen is a criminally underrated actor and one that certainly deserves more praise...it\\'s just unfortunate that he tends to shine in movies that don\\'t get noticed. Also in the cast is \\'Re-Animator\\' himself, Jeffrey Combs, who shines in a small role as someone in the inquisition. The film isn\\'t wholly serious, and Stuart Gordon has seen fit to add some comic relief to the proceedings, which is OK but I feel that the movie would be better off without any \\'relief\\'. Certain elements from other Poe stories appear, such as a man being bricked in behind a wall, and this film seems to treat it\\'s subject material with respect. The European horror style is a major plus factor in my opinion, and should please fans of movies from the sixties and seventies. On the whole; surprisingly good!',\n",
       " 'OK, sorry, I couldn\\'t resist. Though this is a pretty grim movie at times, I can\\'t hear the phrase \"Spanish Inquisition\" without going through the Monty Python routine. Once the movie starts, however, I am always so engrossed I forget about the sketch.<br /><br />This movie had me hooked from the first scene the first time I saw it, but it has that rare quality of actually getting better with every viewing. As many have said, this is without a doubt Full Moon\\'s all-time best. I\\'m a diehard Stuart Gordon fan, and if it wasn\\'t for Re-Animator, I might say it was Gordon\\'s best, too. By the way, the first scene is very grisly and cold-blooded, and you *know* it\\'s gonna be a great movie when that happens even before the opening credits.<br /><br />I\\'m really saddened that this movie didn\\'t get more of a chance for wide release. I remember it being in the theater for maybe one week and then going to video, and the only reason I even knew it existed was from reading Fangoria. Look at the cast- while they aren\\'t all considered \"A-list\", they are favs among horror and cult fans- Lance Henriksen (Millennium, Aliens) Tom Towles (Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer), Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, From Beyond), Frances Bay (Blue Velvet), Oliver Reed... I think the other strike it has against it is that people see the title (maybe that\\'s why it was changed in some versions, including the R-rated DVD that I rented, to The Inquisitor) and figure it\\'s a travesty to even try to remake. Some friends wouldn\\'t even give the movie a chance (to the point where they didn\\'t even want to look at the box, they were so scornful) until I had to beg them to watch it- they thanked me after the first few scenes.<br /><br />Don\\'t get me wrong, the original is wonderful, and Vincent Price is, well, Vincent Price and in a class by himself. However, this movie has very little in common with Corman\\'s other than the title, the fact that both movies are based on Poe\\'s work, and that there\\'s a scene towards the end where some unlucky b*stard tries to get free before the pendulum slices him in half. The similarities end there, however, and I don\\'t think it\\'s fair or accurate to call it a remake.<br /><br />This version is actually set back in Spain during 1492, the REAL inquisition. Lance Henriksen, who can make his voice sound so quietly evil that Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter sounds harmless by comparison, stars as Torquemada. With the assistance of his underlings, he wants to rid the world of witchcraft and heresy, figuring the best way to do this is to torture and kill what seems like 99% of the population (historically, he was said to be responsible of over 100,000 executions). During one ugly public display involving Gordon\\'s wife Carolyn Purdy-Gordon -other than Re-animator, she always seems to come to a horrible end in his movies) the young baker Antonio and his lovely wife Maria make the mistake of trying to intervene, so they assume she\\'s a witch and toss her in the dungeon. In her cell, she\\'s befriended by kindly Esmeralda. In one of the most clever twists, her cellmate turns out to be the one out of the tens of thousands accused who actually IS a witch. Maria\\'s husband tries to save her and of course is immediately arrested as well. Unfortunately for Maria, ole Torq is horrified to find himself secretly attracted to her (he\\'s a monk, and as Henriksen explains in the feauturette, has \\'probably never gotten any in his life\\') and doesn\\'t know how to deal with it. At first it seems like Maria might be able to use this to her advantage, but since Torq is so psychotically religious that he thinks any human emotions are the work of Satan, things just get more complicated and intense from there.<br /><br />There are several references other than the Pendulum to Poe\\'s work -clever ones, that fit in with the plot and are not just tossed in for the hell of it. Someone is walled up, even quoting the notorious line \"For the love of God!\" \"Yes...for the love of God\" is the grim reply. A cask of wine is revealed to be Amontillado. There\\'s also subtle references to \"The Premature Burial\" and probably more I missed.<br /><br />One of the elements that is actually kind of amusing in a horrible way is that you have absolutely NO chance against the evil forces in this movie, to the point where it is ludicrous. You\\'re reasonably attractive? You\\'re obviously trying to tempt men and must be a witch. You\\'re ugly? That\\'s also a sign of being a witch. You look normal? You\\'re a witch disguised as a normal person! You try to fight back when they tear your clothes off to \\'examine\\' you? You\\'re not co-operating, you\\'re a witch! You give up and co-operate? You\\'re an evil whore! You have a mole or freckle anywhere on your body? That\\'s the mark of the devil and you\\'re a witch. Oh, you don\\'t have any? Someone will pinch you and make a mark. Oh, the mark is starting to fade? You\\'re using your evil powers to make it fade! You\\'re just completely screwed no matter what. Also, if they haven\\'t tortured you yet and you confess first to get it over with? Sorry, no such luck! You might just be trying to avoid torture, so confession doesn\\'t officially count until you\\'ve been tortured for days-that is, if you don\\'t die under torture (\"Not another one!\" a torturer complains in exasperation at one point).<br /><br />The cast is amazing. There\\'s not even near enough room to list all the great acting in this movie. Standouts are Henriksen, who not only portrays total evil all too convincingly but the inner struggle against his lust for Maria VS his \\'holy duty\\'. Oliver Reed has less than 10 minutes of screen time as a heavy-drinking Cardinal who comes to visit Torquemada and try to get him to ease up on the mass killing a little, but trust me, you\\'ll remember his scene long after the movie is over. Jeffrey Combs, as the scribe with the prince Valiant haircut and huge horn-rimmed Harry Potter glasses who seems to be the only one involved who is \"just doing his job\" and not getting off on it like all of Torquemada\\'s other flunkies, steals every scene he\\'s in. A less talented actor would have been forgettable in what could have been a boring part, but he makes the most of every second of his screen time. He also gets the some of the best and funniest lines (\"How can they confess if they DON\\'T HAVE TONGUES??\"), including the best in the movie along with the actress playing Esmeralda. She\\'s wonderful, and one of the best and most memorable scenes of this, or any horror movie for that matter, involves her show-stopping revenge when she\\'s burned at the stake. As she\\'s being dragged up, Comb\\'s character actually tells her apologetically: \"I\\'m sorry that you weren\\'t properly able to confess. There just wasn\\'t enough time to torture you\". Esmeralda: \"Thanks anyway\". <br /><br />Not only am I running out of room to rave about how much I loved this movie, but I don\\'t want to talk it up so much that I ruin it. Just watch, enjoy, and get the bejeezus scared out of you. Make sure you are not going to be interrupted for 90 minutes, because it is so riveting you do NOT want to have to turn it off even for a minute. Watch, and prepare to be impressed. Caution: this is NOT a movie for kids, or easily upset adults. The movie pulls NO punches in the graphic portrayal of extremely nasty tortures and executions. The movie is scary and disturbing enough; I try not to dwell to long on the fact that it is based on historical events. In the words of a character during a climactic moment that you won\\'t forget for a long time...\"Welcome to Hell!\"',\n",
       " \"If you've seen the classic Roger Corman version starring Vincent Price it's hard to put it out of your head, but you probably should do because this one is totally different. Subtlety has been abandoned in favour of gross-out horror - nudity, gore and all-round unpleasantness. OK it's ridiculous, trashy, sensationalised and historically dubious (did any members of the Inquisition really wear horn-rimmed glasses?), but despite all this it is strangely compelling. I literally couldn't tear myself away from the screen until the end of the movie. If there's a bigger compliment you can pay to a film I don't know what it is.\",\n",
       " 'I really enjoyed watching this movie and I wish to recommend to as many people as possible. But maybe biased because I\\'m a huge fan of director Stuart Gordon. I have yet to see a movie of his that doesn\\'t fully lives up to my expectations. From Re-Animator over Dolls to Castle Freak...they all belong to my favorite horror movies. And I do believe Gordon belongs to the most talented directors in the genre because he can handle all sort of horror topics. His debut - the brilliant Re-Animator - was a comedy splatter movie while The Pit and the Pendulum doesn\\'t contain that much violence or gore. This movie contains an intelligent and even educational story and it has great settings and costumes of the 14th century. <br /><br />The Pit and the Pendulum is an adaptation of the famous short story by Edgar Allen Poe. The master of low budget - Roger Corman - already used this story once to make a great horror classic starring Vincent Price. Stuart Gordon\\'s movie isn\\'t really a remake of that one. They just used the same plot. Pit and the Pendulum takes place during the Spanish Inquisition. Lance Henriksen plays one of the best roles of his entire career as Torquemada. He decides whether \"witches\" are guilty or not and when they\\'ll be burned for the eyes of God. A young girl, Maria ( played by Ronna De Ricci who never did anything else in her career )who resists against his way of working is being arrested. Torquemada wants to accuse her of witchery but he\\'s fascinated by her looks and her body. Meanwhile, Maria\\'s husband entered the castle and he wants to free his wife. <br /><br />The atmosphere and the settings impress the most in this movie. The ancient castle and the torture chambers are really intriguing. The costumes are terrific as well. There isn\\'t too much gore and violence to detect in this movie ( especially not compared to previous Gordon movies ) but they\\'re are a few very explicit scenes that show true horror. But it\\'s always shot with a lot of style and class. Even though Lance Henriksen is getting all the attention in this movie, there are a a few other great performances in this movie. I\\'d like to bring forward Jeffrey Combs...my favorite B-movie actor and frequently cast by Stuart Gordon. His role is pretty limited but very well acted.<br /><br />The Pit and Pendulum is warmly recommended to fans of atmospheric horror and historical stories. One to watch !!',\n",
       " \"Adapted from perhaps one of the greatest Dark story tellers of the past Edgar Allan Poe.<br /><br />This film was very enjoyable Oliver Reeds accent was very believable but I was really surprised at how a big name actor like Reed only had a very small part in the film.<br /><br />Mark Margolis (Of Equalizer fame) played a really good part - Very Dark!<br /><br />Rona De Ricci who played Maria She was in my opinion the real star of the film. It's surprising then, that she seems to have been in only two films. She is both a very talented actress and a strikingly beautiful woman.<br /><br />Lance Henrikson played His part extremely well as the very tortured inquisitor.<br /><br />The scene with the Rats - brilliant.<br /><br />Over all this film is one that I will remember.\",\n",
       " 'Good flick from back in the days when Full Moon Entertainment was serious about making them. Not much of a known cast, however they all put out excellent performances, especially Lance Henriksen who is one of my favorites. Well told story. I strongly recommend this one for Lance Henriksen fans, or someone who wants to see what Full Moon was able to do in their heyday.',\n",

       " \"The Pit and the Pendulum is set in Toledo in Spain during 1492 as the Spanish Inquisition lead by Torquemada (Lance Henriksen) would strike fear into the hearts of the local population, they would mercilessly torture anyone they thought guilty of witchcraft. While at a public execution a kind hearted woman named Maria (Rona De Ricci) speaks out against the inquisition & it's methods, straight away she is accused of being a witch & carted off to be tortured while her baker boyfriend Antonio (Jonathan Fuller) is left for dead. When he comes round he bribes a castle guard named Gomez (Stephen Lee, no not the British snooker player...) to let him in as he tries to rescue Maria, unfortunately Antonio is caught himself & he too is tortured. Is there any way Antonio & Maria can escape the horrors of the Spanish Inqusition & save themselves...<br /><br />Directed by Stuart Gordon (my on screen digital TV guide claimed it was directed by someone called Stuart Corman!) & based on the story by Edgar Allan Poe this is a pretty good period horror flick. Poe's story had already been turned into a film by Roger Corman as he directed Pit and the Pendulum (1961) staring Vincent Price although this 90's version has next to nothing in common with Corman's flick other than the title & even that was changed to The Inquisitor for it's US DVD release, the script by Dennis Paoli is pretty good here, the character's are better than one would expect with Henriksen obviously having fun playing the part of Torquemada as he's a character with some depth even if not a particularly likable one although I'm not sure about that silly hair-cut. The dialogue is OK & it moves along at a reasonable pace but I couldn't help thinking there wasn't much to it, I mean two people are accused of witchcraft & they get tortured by the Spanish Inquisition who abuse their own power & that's about it, there's a small sub-plot about the pope wanting to end the torture of the Inqusition but this is quickly forgotten & comes to nothing. I didn't like the ambiguous nature of the witches either, I mean were they real witches or not? Why the secrecy? So there you have it, if this sounds exciting to you or you like watching people getting tortured then The Pit and the Pendulum is the film for you, as for me I liked it but mostly because of Hendriksen & it's torture scenes. I know, I'm sick.<br /><br />Director Gordon does alright, the Italian castle locations look nice enough I suppose but I couldn't help but feel it was all a little flat & bland. There's certainly no real style or visual flair here that Gordon showed in his earlier films, there's a pretty nasty down beat atmosphere running through the film & it certainly isn't a feel good flick as there are no happy endings on show. Don't expect a fact based history lesson either I doubt there's much fact here apart from the Spanish inquisition themselves. While there are plenty of torture scenes The Pit and the Pendulum surprisingly isn't that graphic, there's some blood splatter, someone is impaled on spikes, a rat is sliced in half, people are burned at the stake & various scenes of torture which aren't particularly intense. There's some full frontal nudity as well if that's your thing.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 this looks nice enough if a little forgettable, it's reasonably well made with better than average production values & decent period detail although most of it takes place in the same room. The acting is pretty good even if a potentially great cast is wasted, Oliver Reed, Jeffrey Combs, Stephen Lee & Tom Towles are somewhat underused.<br /><br />The Pit and the Pendulum is a fine horror film, it's not the most complex or absorbing film ever but for some exploitative nudity & torture it delivers & frankly you can't argue with exploitative nudity & torture. I liked it, I just wish it had been a bit more graphic & the story was a bit meatier. Still a good effort though.\",\n",
       " \"I think Rona da Ricci (Maria) is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. If anyone has any pictures, information or her phone number, I'd be very interested...<br /><br />This is a horrifically dark adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's story, set in the oppressively religious society of Spain at the time of the Inquisition. The film is well-written, although a few things don't quite sit right with me. Firstly, the comic relief character is a bit vacuous. (At least, I think he was supposed to be funny...) Secondly, there is reference to the Roman Catholic Church trying to stop the Grand Inquisitor from murdering innocent people in the name of God. I somehow doubt that the organization that instigated and perpetuated these massacres over the centuries, in whatever manifestation worked for the time and place, would turn so vehemently against it at any stage, let alone against a wing of it's own organization. I think it was something of a cop-out on the part of the creators of this film. Apart from this, however, the film is enthralling, intriguing and predominately well-acted (though the male lead leaves something to be desired). Also, the cinematography deserves a mention.<br /><br />Not for everyone, but if you have a strong stomach, it's definitely worth a look.\",\n",
       " 'The Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada(Lance Henriksen), known for his public executions and torturous methods of those he and his foot-soldiers deem heretics and witches, is overcome with lust when he gazes upon the naked body of baker Antonio\\'s(Jonathan Fuller)lovely wife Maria(the stunning beauty Rona De Ricci)on trial for being a witch after halting the never-ending whipping of a boy child in front of a crowd of people. The film shows Torquemada\\'s battle with his desire for Maria and how Antonio will try to save her, which will not be an easy task.<br /><br />I think the main success of this film is Lance Henriksen\\'s powerful performance as the sadistic, psychotic Inquisitor. While his chosen men, Gomez(Stephen Lee)and Dr. Huesos(William J Norris)bask in the joy of making others suffer, Don Carlos(Tom Towles)drunk with the role of captain riding his horse with great pride, and Francisco(Jeffrey Combs, who looks like a bookish accountant tending to his recorded testimonies of sin and acknowledgments of witchcraft as if he were an IRS agent seeking debts owed by clients)logging the accused, very business-like, with little remorse, Torquemada is completely serious in his role as executioner and judge wielding his power as if he were the mighty hand of God striking down anyone he so chooses. Henriksen\\'s always intense and frighteningly believable..I do feel that he best represents what kind of monster those Inquisitors were like during this horrible time in history. While we often watch as his victims suffer, thanks to director Stuart Gordon and screenwriter Dennis Paoli, those who mistreat get their comeuppance in the end. It\\'s fun watching Torquemada fall prey to his own madness, guilt, hypocrisy & buried iniquities which surface and confront him in a fantastically realized climax.<br /><br />Frances Bay steals every scene she\\'s in as accused and imprisoned witch Esmeralda, who befriends Maria and gets revenge on hecklers and executioners when she\\'s set at the the stake to burn with the use of gunpowder. Mark Margolis ably portrays the abused torturer Mendoza, a puppet Torquemada(..and his goons)uses to do his dirty work(..he has these nasty Christ-like wounds on his hands which Torquemada gave to him as punishment as a reminder of what can happen when you \"sin\"). Stuart Gordon\\'s wife, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon(..as an ancestor of one Torquemada deems a heretic as his torturer whips the skeletal remains of an unearthed corpse!) gets you-know-what again(..he likes to murder his wife on film in devious ways)and it\\'s quite a grisly fate..she is strangled by a rope over the back of an executioner as her child watches helplessly. Oliver Reed has a very memorable cameo as a visiting Cardinal, with quite the taste for drink, who brings orders from the Pope for Torquemada to end his violent methods, meeting a horrifying end(..yep, the dependable wall entombment).<br /><br />I also loved the preposterous, but ingenious, way one escapes the swinging razor-sharp pendulum which closes in to his body thanks to rats. That pit of spikes, underneath a trap door where the poor victim lies as the pendulum swings, is also put to good use.And, I think that Gordon utilizes Rona De Ricci\\'s beauty and innocence quite well..she\\'s certainly a sympathetic figure we root for as it seems her fate is doomed because of the trap Torquemada has placed her in. But, this is Henriksen\\'s movie..he\\'s a force of nature and Gordon ideally shoots him in sinister ways. You do not want this man pointing you out of a crowd for the possibility of consorting with the DEVIL, that\\'s for sure.',\n",
       " 'Set during the Spanish Inquisition, this take on the Poe story features Grand Inquisitor Torquemada (Lance Henriksen in a marvelously intense performance) engaging in various acts of torture to get citizens to confess to witchcraft. He targets young baker Antonio (Jonathan Fuller) and his wife Maria (the amazingly alluring Rona De Ricci, who looks great in and out of clothes), only to find himself lusting after her. He then proceeds to torture her, concluding that his lust can only be the result of her \"bewitching\" him.<br /><br />Putting aside anachronisms such as the lack of accents and the rather modern way much of the dialog is delivered, this is a solid effort from veteran genre director Gordon. It looks fantastic, with impressive sets and costumes. In his ever enjoyable fashion, Gordon spices it up with plenty of violence and his great touch for black humor. Granted, the broader comedy relief (courtesy of Torquemadas\\' clownish associates played amusingly by Jeffrey Combs, Stephen Lee, and William J. Norris) I could have done without, but overall the film is commendably as intense as Henriksens\\' central performance. It\\'s very striking, involving (De Ricci not only is very attractive, she really gets to the heart of her impassioned character), and lavish, with a typically fine music score by Richard Band.<br /><br />The strong supporting cast contributes equally vivid turns; Frances Bay, Tom Towles, Mark Margolis are all excellent as well. Gordons\\' actress wife Carolyn turns up, and as usual, there\\'s a graphic demise in store for her. Oliver Reed pops up about halfway through the movie in a nice cameo as a Cardinal.<br /><br />It\\'s a great Full Moon production and a film that any fan of Gordons\\' \"Re-Animator\" or \"From Beyond\" ought to see.<br /><br />8/10',\n",
       " 'The Roman Catholic Church has begun to turn away from the Inquisition, finding its methods and motives more than just a little bit suspect. But the Grand Inquisitor of Spain (Lance Henriksen) has other plans... he is his own authority, allegedly guided by God Himself. A baker and his wife end up on the wrong side of the law -- his law -- when they protest an execution and she is accused of witchcraft.<br /><br />Lance Henriksen has a bad habit of appearing in many low budget horror films, so much so that any credibility he gained as Bishop from \"Aliens\" or Frank Black from \"Millenium\" is overshadowed by his constant self-degradation. Did we really need so many Pumpkinhead films? But \"Pit and the Pendulum\" is one of those films I remember fondly from my childhood and even today feel carries on well as a timeless classic.<br /><br />Unlike other Full Moon films, this one has a steady plot and interesting characters -- and a decent cast. Mark Margolis shows up and Jeffrey Combs has a relatively small, but crucial, role to play. (Combs, like Henriksen, has sold out in recent years.... but his very presence makes a film better.) There\\'s excessive -- but not gratuitous -- nudity, bloody torture devices (but not to the point of exploitation like \"Saw\", just for entertainment). This is a fun film in the vein of, say, the original \"Troll\" (but not \"Troll 2\").<br /><br />I can understand wanting to avoid this film, but I think you\\'d be making a mistake. It\\'s hard to find films that are this much fun today. Blending horror and pure enjoyment isn\\'t impossible, but it seems to be a dying art. Make this one a must-see on your list.',\n",

       " 'This is Lance Henriksen\\'s best performance to date, and he\\'s done some amazing work (but some horrible movies, but what of it?). He\\'s hypnotically possessed as the Grand Inquisitor Tourquemada (sp?) who falls for the \"beautiful, virginal, ...innocent..., etc\" helpless women who is only trying to help her husband. She really is nothing more than a pretty cipher willing to undress onscreen, but it gives Lance a chance to show off his tortured, sexual side. It\\'s quite a doozy, his performance, and he should get the recognition he deserves. One aside: Lance looks good bald, doesn\\'t he?',\n",
       " \"This movie was not what I expected. I expected more suspence and alot more acting in order to keep me interested in the film. This movie takes place in the early 14th century when the Spanish Inquisition was at it's peak. A bald headed man that plays the part of a priest tries citizens of all kinds of wrongdoing against the Bible when he himself is not so innocent. He falls in love with a bakers wife and makes sure in his own way that she does not tell anyone of his true identity. His associates follow along with with him as they try to gain power and fame themselves using public exicutions and torture. This movie is slow and at times boring. The actors are no name actors played by people who can't act. Other than the brief special appearance by Oliver Reed who for the small role that he played as Cardinal he could have done a better job of speaking the fake Spanish accent. There are better versions of this film..... watch Vincent Price's version before you get bored with this one.\",\n",
       " \"I've seen the movie at the Malaga Festival, Spain. It's one of the BEST GOTHIC STORIES OF ALL TIMES. It's a peculiar mixture between The Silent of the Lambs and Sleepy Hollow or From Hell. It's more than a normal horror werewolf movie. Much more. It's a story where gothic meets romance, where horror meets love, where documentary meets fairytale. Yes. 'cause this is a TRUE STORY!!! Manuel Blanco Romasanta is one of the most intriguing serial killers of all times. He was judged in Spain in 1852. having confessed the killing of at least 13 people, he dared proclaim his innocence: he was not guilty because he was a werewolf! The thing I liked most is the way the authors introduce us in a REAL FAIRYTALE. I don't find other words to describe this story. it's fantasy and reality at the same time. It's like to be at the same time in a chapter of CSI and in the tale of Red Riding Hood. We experience this adventure from the point of view of Barbara, the woman who falls in love with Manuel Romasanta and who progressively changes her love into rage.. The arc of the character is so well developed, that the identification with her is complete. We do feel the same love and the same hatred that Barbara felt towards Manuel. Another strong point of the movie is the cast. and moreover the female roles. The actresses who play Barbara and her sister Maria are superb. I really enjoyed the way they expressed their arena. Finally, last but not least, I do suggest to keep an eye on this young director: Paco Plaza. Believe me, he's a TRUE GENIUS.\",\n",
       " \"'Romasanta' tells the chilling tale of Manuel Blanco Romasanta, known murderer of 15 people (although confessing to murdering many more) and how he charms women before killing them brutally like a wolf. When we are introduced to Romasanta a wolf backs away in fear from him, and this saves the life of the heroine Bárbera. Romasanta is going with Bárbera's sister and they leave Bárbera behind to go to another town to secure a place to live and a home, running in fear of the wolves that have been killing the town folk. On the way to the new town, Romasanta kills his 'girlfriend' and her daughter and then returns to seduce Bárbera. She suspects that Romasanta has killed her sister and niece and sets out to have justice brought to him.<br /><br />Julian Sands (Romasanta) is excellent in this chilling Gothic tale, portraying the character with such eerie class that makes the film as good as it is. This is no ordinary werewolf movie, it is a psychological thriller, looking at the mind-set of a man suffering from lycanthropy, making him turn mentally to a beast but making him feel the physicality of it.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent Gothic tale, a new take on werewolf movies and I would say that it is better than most films involving werewolves. What's more, it is based on real events. Excellently filmed and acted, especially by Julian Sands. Definitely worth watching. From me, 9/10.<br /><br />Cat §quire\",\n",
       " 'If you\\'re one of those people who quite enjoyed \"La Pacte des Loups\" (Brotherhood of the Wolf) a few years back but were left disappointed by some of the more ridiculous historical inaccuracies, then you might want to take a look at Romasanta.<br /><br />The story of Manuel Blanco Romasanta is quite a well known one in Spain. It happened in the mid-nineteenth century, when a string of violent deaths took place which seemed in some ways like animal attacks, and in others like cold and calculated murder. Eventually a man was arrested -- Manuel Romasanta, and it was found that he used the body fat from his victims to make soap. At his trial he claimed that he became a werewolf, and that it is the nature of a wolf to kill. He was diagnosed with the psychological condition of lycanthropy, and given a life sentence rather than death.<br /><br />The film itself is based largely on truth, partly on speculation and partly on pure invention for artistic purposes. It\\'s certainly a lot closer to the truth than \"Brotherhood of the Wolf\" was, anyway. One character is knowingly invented, and some rather unlikely theories are put forward in the place of that which is unknown, but the question of whether or not Romasanta was actually a werewolf is left completely open. Paco Plaza appears to be a competent and innovative director, and the style of the film is really superb. It is quite slow moving, and arguably it\\'s rather light on actual story and plot, but that\\'s about as far as the criticism goes.<br /><br />There are several great performances, but the standout comes from Julian Sands as the title character, who submerges himself in the role in the way that only outstanding actors can. John Sharian is also very good as the misguided, haunted \\'partner\\' of Romasanta, and both Gary Piquer and David Gant are memorable in supporting roles as those who finally bring the murderer to justice. It also features Elsa Pataky as the leading heroine, who has become a huge sex symbol in Spain and it isn\\'t hard to see why -- think along the lines of a Spanish Keira Knightley.<br /><br />This is the finest historical werewolf film I\\'ve ever seen, and any self-respecting werewolf buff should take a look, but unfortunately there\\'s not much chance of this one being a blockbuster.',\n",
       " 'An interesting story, with good acting, well told. Good direction, visually appealing, atmospheric.<br /><br />However, scientifically, and/or historically literate viewers will find one nagging, glaring blunder; at one point in this story, which is supposed to be set in the mid 19th century, there is a reference to a person being controlled \"by his genes\". Come on! The term \"gene\" wasn\\'t even proposed until half a century later, and additionally, around mid 19th century the mechanism of inheritance was entirely unknown; Mendel\\'s work lay undiscovered until early 20th century, and even Mendel didn\\'t use the word \"gene\" (so it couldn\\'t have been a case of some exceptionally insightful scientist having discovered the term in some ).<br /><br />That sort of a slip may not seem much, but for someone aware of this history, it does brake the illusion of an authentic world in which the events are set, making it harder to enjoy the movie. I\\'m surprised that anybody reviewing the script didn\\'t pick up on it... but then again, the state of scientific literacy among filmmakers is often abysmal. In a movie set in a historical period, accuracy should be more of a priority though, I think.<br /><br />The story proceeds almost languidly, punctuated by moments of violence and terror; perhaps too slow for most horror fans to appreciate, and those who do appreciate the subtlety are likely to be bothered by the \"gene\" mishap. The score is beautiful, and lighting is used to good effect; the combination makes for a visually and auditorily pleasing experience.<br /><br />Perhaps because of how the movie is portrayed as a werewolf movie, the people who might best enjoy it, aren\\'t likely to see it, and the people expecting a traditional supernatural horror movie might feel a bit let down.<br /><br />In conclusion, Romasanta is a movie not as good as it could have been, and somewhat misleadingly advertised on the cover, but well worth seeing nonetheless. I was torn between 7 or 8 stars, and decided to be generous. :)',\n",

I like the original title better, but on the other hand it might not have piqued my interest if it hadn\\'t had \"werewolf\" in the title! It is a horror story and a love story. The acting is above average and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The story is somewhat based on a true story about a man tried and imprisoned for 15 murders in 19th century Spain. His defense was that he was in fact, a werewolf and had no control over himself once he transformed. The murders are quite gruesome. The few scenes of animal abuse disturbed me more, but that\\'s just me.<br /><br />If you love the genre as I do, this movie is worth watching.',\n",

Once in prison, he dies for unknown cause.<br /><br />First of all, I would like to tell that I am not writing a spoiler: most of this information is on the box of the Brazilian DVD and in many reviews. I believe the lack of mystery with the lead character, i.e., the viewer knows who is the killer before watching the film, is the greatest flaw in this screenplay. The story is great, recalling \"La Pacte des Loups\"; the cinematography and effects are wonderful; and Julian Sands and Elsa Pataky have excellent performances and chemistry, with the story centered in their romance first, and in the rage of Bárbara for Romasanta later. However, I have never heard about this Romasanta, and the writer used fictional and historical events to write this story, with elements of horror and romance. I believe he could have kept the mystery about Romasanta, disclosing his crimes only in the end. Anyway, this movie is original and very attractive and really worth watching.

The wolf\\'s mouth is larger than that of an ordinary dog, the teeth packed more densely together within. The wolf\\'s eyes gleam a sickly yellow colour, and a vicious snarl augments the drool flowing from its mouth.<br /><br />The creature leaps at you with supernatural speed and strength. Its front paws knock you flat on your back, and you feel the freezing earth soaking through your shirt, the full moon gleaming down like a cruel eye, watching you.<br /><br />The wolf doesn\\'t bother with a killing wound; it just begins to tear chunks of flesh from your stomach, ignoring your agonized screams. It will be a long, long time before your body loses all feeling, and everything goes dark.<br /><br />Manuel Romasanta was a traveling merchant and salesman in the mid eighteen hundreds, who, at some point, went completely and utterly insane. He believed himself to be a werewolf, a man who would assume the form of an unnaturally large and brutal wolf whenever the moon was full. Manifesting from this belief was the need to kill, and so kill he did, some sixteen or more people, chosen completely at random, no discrimination. He would slaughter them, devour them and then leave the bodies for others to find.<br /><br />There have been so many movies made that have been based on the lives of serial killers- Jack the Ripper, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, etc. It seemed a mere matter of time until they dredged up this psychopath from the history books and immortalized him through film. <br /><br />But, of course, being set in the time that it is, and under the circumstances through which the events surrounding the case unfolded, they couldn\\'t have been content merely to make a slasher/thriller sort of thing documenting the life of a serial killer. No, they had to turn it into a werewolf movie.<br /><br />And what a fantastic werewolf movie it turned out to be. I was expecting the sorts of cheesy werewolf effects that we saw in such movies as \"Dog Soldiers\" and \"Underworld\" (although to tell you the truth, I enjoyed both of those movies, solely for the action content in them). But groundless were all my fears, for as the movie progresses it becomes increasingly clear that this is not your usual, run-of-the-mill type of werewolf crap, with Romasanta assuming the form of a proper wolf when he transforms. Rather than \"Dog Soldiers\", it portrays itself more as being along the lines of \"Ginger Snaps\", with much the same sort of tragic tale at the heart of it.<br /><br />As with seemingly all new-age horror movies, even those done in an older sort of style (such as this one), there is a love story at the heart of the movie. However, true to the bizarre nature of this movie, it is not a happy tale of love that unfolds, rather a twisted tragedy in which neither side comes off any better than the other. For those of you who possess something like a twisted romanticism, I tell you now not to miss this one, you\\'ll regret it if you do.<br /><br />I\\'ve already told you basically all you need to know about the story of this movie, and I\\'m not going to ruin all the twists and turns of the movie so as to spoil your viewing enjoyment.

Romasanta (Julian Sands) might be the culprit, only problem is there is a raging sexual chemistry between them, but after her sister and niece disappear, Barbara decides she must act. Romasanta comes clean before a court, that he is in fact a wolf who takes the guise of a man to seduce his victims, is he a wolf or just a psychotic killer? Romasanta is a beautifully filmed period drama, that explores more the myth of the killings than lycantrophy. Those expecting wolf men will be disappointed, but those who like a good story and terrors that are for the most part only alluded to, will enjoy this one.

Romasanta and Anonia. I was afraid the movie would try to trick you into thinking he was really a werewolf or leave you with questions but it didn't. It took you through a nice recreation of the original events with some decent added story.<br /><br />If you like horror thrillers...not a bad rent!\",\n",
       " \"A wolf becomes man to seduce and kill female victims in Allariz. Romasanta(Julian Sands)goes on record in front of a jury of his peers and the court proclaiming himself a werewolf. Almost all of Romasanta's conquests were not of anything remotely human until he falls in love with Bárbara(Elsa Pataky, a stunning beauty), the sister of his wife and mute child. When Romasanta kills his wife, María(Maru Valdivielso)and mute child Teresa(Luna McGill), Bárbara seeks him out after being seduced herself by him. Joining forces with DA Bastida(Bary Piquer)they are on the hunt to find him before more and more lives are taken by the wolf. With help by Antonio(John Sharian), someone bitten and controlled by Romasanta, they might just be able to find him. Professor Philips(David Grant is a persuasive doctor who proclaims that Romasanta is not responsible for the killer impulses the wolf brings out.<br /><br />Handsome production and great photography help the flick which doesn't produce the goods in werewolf transformations, instead opting for being a historical document on a serial killer stating on record he is a werewolf who can not help but kill when the beast comes out to play. The acting is adequate and there are a few brief moments of violence, but many viewers wanting a full-fledged creature feature with gory attacks will be disappointed, perhaps even bored. But, the film is well made and visually sumptuous. Just don't expect blood and guts.\",\n",
       " \"I was really disappointed by this film. Having seen Julian Sands' name on the box, I thought 'OK, well, he's been in some pretty bad films (Arachnophobia, Boxing Helena etc.), but he's also been good in things, so I'll give it a go'. Plus it was screened at last year's Frightfest, which is usually a guide to a film's quality. Having a Spanish director also sounded good, given that it was set in Spain...<br /><br />But whilst the setting, costumes etc. were all amazing, and the script was pretty good, the actors really let it down, particularly Mr Sands, the lead actress and the professor - I couldn't take any of his scenes seriously! Probably worth seeing if you haven't got anything better to do, but don't expect a masterpiece or quality acting (with the exception of Antonio, who was well worth the cost of rental).\",\n",
       " \"The story of Romasanta is interesting because it is based on true historical events. The movie interpretion however doesn't quite capture the excitement of the Wolfman killings.<br /><br />Pacing of the story is poorly synchronized: everything happens way too slow in the first half of the movie. And suddenly all the way from the capture of Romasanta the pace quickens considerably and the movie is over before my curiosity on the Romasanta character is completely satisfied: Who was he? Why did he do these things? This movie doesn't answer or even ask these questions well enough. Quite contrary, just when I became intrigued by Romasanta, he is swept away and the movie ends. To be truthful, I think in the end it gives quite a neutral and rather dull view on Manuel Romasanta. But on defensive side I must say that the cinematography, settings and props look all wonderful.<br /><br />Short summary: Romasanta is magnificently set movie with pure Gothic feeling, but it unfortunately lacks somewhat in the script and pacing. You can watch it once or twice without any serious pain, but the lost possibilities do bother me. If I weren't so curious about the real Romasanta, this movie might have seen even worse in my eyes. This could have been truly great historical werewolf/horror movie. Now it manages to be only barely average.<br /><br />I'm a little bit disappointed in the results considering the raw potential of the plot. Oh well, nice try.\",\n",
       " \"The misleadingly titled Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt is a disappointing pile of slow, plodding period serial killer rubbish. There are no real werewolves, only that which goes on within the title character's head, and because it's based on true events the movie is incredibly dry and uninventive in the story department. Add to this the fact that it's punctuated with moments of unnecessary tasteless violence, and you have a fairly unsatisfying product.<br /><br />I can't really understand why Romasanta's gone down so well with people. Yes, I admit it is at times atmospheric, and the actors are very good in it, but the honest truth is despite this, it's dull, boring and at times deeply unpleasant. I really could have lived without seeing a deaf child caught in a bear trap, then systematically have her eyes gouged out. Even in a GOOD movie, such a scene would force me to seriously question what the director was attempting to accomplish, but in a movie so ineffectual as this it just seems pointless, tasteless and sensational.<br /><br />Still, as I have stated, I could have stomached the violence given my history of watching a lot of violent movies, were the movie in any way enthralling, but Romasanta is like cinematic wallpaper. With the exception of Romasanta's horrific acts, which you never see him caught in the act of anyway, Romasanta really left me with the impression that nothing happened. Romasanta isn't at all sympathetic as a character, given that he kills and robs indiscriminately with immense cruelty throughout the entire film, so his pleas that he is insane toward the end of the movie, obviously supposed to be an emotional high point pass without event or interest, and without this the movie is robbed of any sense of climax.<br /><br />To be honest, I expected very little from Romasanta, but I did expect a werewolf, which it didn't produce, and I expected a plot with high and low points and obvious progression, which it didn't produce either. If you have to see this RENT it, don't buy it, and I'd recommend you don't waste your time either way anyhow.\",\n",
       " \"I watched this movie like months ago and have remembered it ever since I began to try and hunt down the actor that played Manuel! I love this kind of stuff and thought that this movie was awesome. I don't get why people don't like it. Is it because it's not gory? Is it because there no real insight to the killing? Or is it because it's based on a true story? I dunno... I must give this movie a 10 because it's just one of the best werewolf movies I've seen... and I've seen a lot! I love the sensuality of the movie... and the way Teresa's sister finally gets her head on straight and realizes that he must be killed, although I was a little sad. I also loved how the movie just went smoothly, never contradicting itself like many movies do. This movie may not explain werewolves, but it does do the race some justice after movies like American Werewolf or American Werewolf in Paris (or something like that) really gave a bad and false view of them. One of the bests I've seen so far! =)\",\n",

They are also quite justified in being disappointed. They are victims of sleight of hand marketing. Don\\'t know where the decision was made but \"whoever\" even chose to present the blurb \"...in the tradition of The Howling\". Nope. In the tradition of \"Gothic\", maybe. I enjoyed this movie but I think I enjoyed because when I learned it was coming, and being the curious person I am, I dug into the story of Manuel Romasanta. This is my suggestion to those who have not seen this movie: 1) Light up your internet and put \"Manuel Romasanta\" into your favorite search engine. Ignore all hits that pertain to this movie and collect a little history about a real life, and seminal, serial killer. 2) Rent the movie understanding it is not \"in the tradition of The Howling\", watch it and decide how these folks handled a murky historical incident involving clinical lycanthropy.<br /><br />I think they did a nice job.',\n",

The only good thing about this film was seeing Elsa Patasky\\'s breasts, everything else was totally shite.It is even more of a shame because the idea has potential. Based on a real life, self confessed \"werewolf\" (well, a dude suffering from lycanthropy), Romasanta had the potential to be seriously creepy, especially with the dark forests of the area and the quaint little villages so horribly afraid of a big bad wolf. Total waste of time. And coming from me, this movie must be poor -I like pretty much every piece of crap ever made.',\n",

       " 'Werewolf Hunter is an elegant Gothic horror film that hearkens back to the days of Hammer, but with the production capabilities of today. The film is not an action packed mixture of violence and CGI transformations like many werewolf films of today have degenerated into but an actual leisurely paced film that takes the time to develop its characters. At no time during the film is the viewer ever told that yes this is real or no it is not. It is up to the viewer to make their own decision. The film deals with the true story of Manuel Blanco Romasanta, a man arrested in 1851 for the murder of more than 13 people in rural Spain. He became known as the Werewolf Of Allariz because his defense against these charges was that he could not control his animal urges since he was in fact a werewolf. Some liberties are taken with the case. One character in the film, Antonio, was never actually proved to have existed since he was never found. Also, the ending merely provides a possible explanation since the truth of the matter is unknown to anyone. Paco Plaza has crafted a truly special film that is unfortunately hampered with a dreadful direct to video title but you should get past that and give this one a shot.',\n",

It was an effective and dark film; it wasn\\'t the most original movie I\\'d ever watched, but it was OK, I had a nice and entertaining time (mission accomplished). And now I go and watch this \"Romasanta\", waiting for some excitement, even though the cast wasn\\'t that good (Elsa Pataky, Julian Sands\\x85). And what do I get? A story about wolf-men that never seems to begin, flat like a valley, and without a real climax. The aesthetic has reminded me of \"The Pact Of The Wolves\" (a recent french movie), and the technical aspects such as the photography or the special effects are just great. Anyway, for me a movie is an story, and a nice movie MUST have a nice story, and it has to be well told. Maybe the story in \"Romasanta\" is attractive , but Mr. Plaza hasn\\'t found a way to tell it in a right way.<br /><br />I hope that Plaza\\'s third film will be as good as \"The Second Name\", so we can count on him to make nice fantastic-terror movies (just like Amenábar or Balagueró do).

It was highly creative and almost always witty and funny.

He and co-host Jimmy Kimmell had an excellent chemistry, and their exchanges of jokes and insults were among Comedy Central\\'s finest moments. Very few of the questions were dumbed down for mass consumption, and the show\\'s entertaining and quick pace made it a welcome contrast to the dull and ridiculous \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\" The show did suffer a bit when Nancy Pimental took over as co-host, as she lacked Jimmy\\'s chemistry (he later went on to co-host the insipid \"Man Show\"), but she was fairly competent as a comedian. Ben showed his true talent as an entertainer here, and it resulted in his short-lived spin-off, \"Turn Ben Stein On.\" If your cable providers offer The Game Show Network, due yourselves a favor a catch a rerun of \"Win Ben Stein\\'s Money\" if you\\'re not too busy.

My girlfriend and I had just finished watching John Hurt in Michael Radford’s Nineteen Eighty-Four and I put this documentary on because I thought a nice short colorful coral reef film might be nice after such a grey depressing movie.

Look no matter how you feel about global warming the villain in this piece was clearly those nice Fijians who were logging and overfishing and killed their own damn reef. The movie clearly shows this and then completely ignores its own findings to declare global warming the boogey man (Though in this particular case it was obviously innocent. As local reefs not near the GIANT SILT RUNNOFF and not located IN THE FISHING GROUNDS were thriving.) But the Fijians can’t be guilty of course cause the look so cute in their Sunday best and they have quite a haunting rendition of Marrakesh Express. Such propaganda, no matter how well intentioned, needs to be called to the carpet. In particular when it is aimed towards children.<br /><br />The film has other faults as well. It is over produced by half with wipes and sound effects that look like they belong in a Disney Ducktales movie. Top billed Liam Neeson narrates for all of a minute and top billed Jean-Michel Cousteau appears for about as long.<br /><br />It probably isn’t that bad a film with the mute on.

       " 'A man\\'s relentless drive toward self-destruction is the tenor plot in this film, but the surrounding study of human nature, and of what can be the ultimate values in life fill out the canvas. Squarcio, the hero, has through good fortune escaped detection long enough to establish a comfortable life for his family and loving wife. Other fishermen, who have reason enough to detest him, consistently show him compassion - their basic good natures prevailing. Squarcio, though, like a \"Sturm und Drang\" character, relentlessly pursues a path his logic - and wife and children - tell him he should abandon. He is offered other choices; he sees other charismatic characters uselessly die - yet his actions are emotionally driven.<br /><br />At mid-film, the local coast guard commander chooses to retire, to quit service before having to witness the death or imprisonment of his childhood friend. I, the viewer, felt likewise - very much like abandoning the theater before the inevitable. Yet I stayed on, hoping for some early hint of a happy end to come.<br /><br />But for me, the most memorable moments in this film were certain sea scenes set to challenge the most beautiful and intriguing of any painting of the old Venetian school - sepia sails, emerald seas, white and green (?) hulls, and old fortresses in the background - all looking a bit unreal, like a child\\'s playthings, almost too perfect, too harmonic. Squarcio, of course, wasn\\'t part of such scenes - he was off on his own, individualist but misguided path.',\n",

Both might be considered Italian Neo-realist films, though LA GRAND STRADA AZZURA does feature a big-name actor in the lead (Yves Montand) and a big budget--somethings that a Neo-realist film cannot have to be technically this type of film. However, I am apparently one of the few reviewers on IMDb that really disliked LA TERRA TREMA--because the acting was so incredibly amateurish as well as the lousy camera-work. Instead, LA GRAND STRADA is beautifully filmed in color and Montand is the centerpiece around which all the non-professional actors are anchored.<br /><br />The film itself is also a little more exciting because it deals not just with a family of fishermen like the other film, but a family that illegally uses homemade dynamite to fish!! And the negative impact on the fishing industry and the other fishermen makes for some great tension. While this certainly isn't a great film, it's a very, very good one and has an excellent ending to wrap it all together.<br /><br />By the way, do not get the idea that I dislike Neo-realist films and prefer big-name actors and budgets. No, I actually love movies such as UMBERTO D, MIRACLE IN MILAN and THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US (all by Vittorio De Sica)--it's just that there are also a couple truly awful and amateurishly made Neo-realist films as well that I really hate--and apart from STOMBOLI, LA TERRA TREMA is probably the most boring and unwatchable Neo-realist film I have seen. You are MUCH better off just watching this film--it's very similar but interesting--and avoid LA TERRA TREMA unless you are a masochist and you actually like very slow and miserable films.\",\n",

Even though the advertisement's probably would not work in real life and would probably cause consumer outrage in this politically correct society we live in today,(e.g., Visit New York it's not as filthy as you think), it makes for some good laughs.

       " \"The premise of this movie is simple and hilarious. Moore play an advertising executive who experiences a minor nervous breakdown. Unlike 'Reginald Perrin', who fakes his suicide, Moore's character has a falling-out with deceit. He begins composing advertisements that tell the truth.<br /><br />And this is where the comedy really takes off. Moore's character is confined to an institution, but in the meantime his spoof adverts are accidentally sent to press. As things turn out; the truth has more appeal than lies (why do ad-men and politicians find that so hard to accept?). In the asylum, the plot enters its 'second phase', as we are introduced to a bunch of people with all manner of comic and tragic conditions. It is they who take up the thread of humour in this part. <br /><br />It is also here that things go awry. A romantic sub-plot is farcically attempted by the introduction Of Darly Hannah as a love interest for Moore. Like him; she has also been committed for some reason.<br /><br />The story then struggles between these two digressing strands and the whole plot is stretched too thin to cover them. Dudley Moore was 55 by the time he worked this movie, and much too old to play a romantic lead with a 20-something inmate. Their relationship begins to look uncomfortably like abuse. Darly Hannah has a wonderful face and figure, but not much else. Her coy-and-vulnerable-beauty is a role she would reprise to the letter in 'Splash' with Tom Hanks.<br /><br />There is a happy ending as you would expect; but by then, so many wheels have come off that you no longer take the joke seriously any more. It's a pity John Guilgud wasn't used instead of Ms Hannah. He could have been an insane politician turned philosophical mentor, or some such thing. The plot would have stayed on-track and the gags could have kept on coming. The pairing had already been shown to be a winning formula in 'Arthur'. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby demonstrated that such a franchise could work in the longer-term with their 'Road To...' series.<br /><br />For the most part, this is well worth a watch. Just be ready to make some coffee or get a beer or something when the maudlin and implausible romance takes over. Unless you're a fan of Ms Hannah's physical charms, that is.<br /><br />This was pretty well Dudley Moore's last Hollywood outing. If he'd been 20 years younger I think he would have made the ideal candidate for 'Splash'. But the studios needed a younger vulnerable-funny-guy, and Tom Hanks seems to have been Moore's natural successor. He wasn't as funny, but he wasn't so short and had youth on his side. He was also a yank.<br /><br />If you think this is good, then try 'Bedazzled'. You'll see Cuddly Dudley both at his most endearing, and at the high point of his pairing with Peter Cook.\",\n",

I rate it 10 because it deserves a 10 artistically and creatively as a film. <br /><br />The version to get of The Peach Girl is sold off the San Francisco Silent Film Festival website with the Donald Sosin soundtrack, a lovely one, though for some reason toward the end it sounds a bit warped in spots; I don\\'t know why. This print is gated correctly, though still a bit rough going in terms of visuals; the print has a lot of wear. However if you are the kind of person who can see the diamond here hiding underneath the rough, and wish to see one of the most beautiful Chinese silent films ever made, then don\\'t miss The Peach Girl.<br /><br />Lingyu Ruan was so beautiful and evocative as the peasant girl whose life is symbolic of the peach trees in the countryside where she lives. She falls in love with the son of the rich woman who owns the property she and her father and mother toil on, but is betrayed by him when she gets pregnant out of wedlock. Yan Jin gives an incredible performance as the son; his face was expressive and emotional and brings depth to his role. You feel his agony as his mother locks him in his room for months so that he cannot go find his lost love and make it right by her.<br /><br />The title cards are in Chinese and English, and many have decorative backgrounds, always a plus for me when I watch silent films. It adds visual interest to the story.<br /><br />The Peach Girl (1931) and The Goddess (1934) are the easiest available silent films showcasing the loveliness of \"the Chinese Garbo\", Lingyu Ruan, and both are worthy of your time and interest. It is so tragic that she committed suicide so young. What wonderful performances we were deprived of!',\n",
       " \"A tragic silent-film romance, in which the handsome landlady's son King The-en(Raymond King / Yan Jin) falls in love with Miss Lim (Lily Yuen / Lingyu Ruan) the beautiful daughter of a brave tenant farmer. The mother spurns Lim, sending her home when she visits the town, but The-en instead takes her to his apartment, where she stays, happily, until her father comes to take her home to her mother's deathbed. Lim's father and The-en's mother quarrel\\x97they're both proud\\x97but it turns out badly for the girl's family. The mother dies, the family has to move, the father is blinded defending the Kings' cattle from thieves even after he's been fired. Meanwhile Mrs. King prevents The\\x97en from going to Lim. He's more than a little pusillanimous, really, though the parent-child bond is incredibly strong in Confucian China. He fails to break free until Lim, racked by poverty, lies dying. He takes their child and swears to live for her. Throughout the story there's a regular motif of peach blossoms: Lim's parents plant a peach tree at her birth; peach petals and tears have the same consistency; the sight of a blossoming tree prevents Lim from prostituting herself. The settings are traditional, as are the costumes, but with some westernizing. The-en has a western haircut, some of the women wear wristwatches, and there's a market scene in which the crowds wear Chinese clothes and western hats. The film is wonderful as a source for pre-revolutionary China, though the pastoral scenes are mostly pretty much idealized. And Lingyu Ruan is not only very beautiful, but she has an extraordinarily expressive face, especially when she's happy, when she looks a little like 21st-century model Vivian Hsu. She's the best thing this movie has to offer.\",\n",

The man (Teh-en) is of a higher station than Miss Lim, played by the beautiful, gone way too soon Lily Yuen. You see the sweetness in her eyes and fall in love with her. His mom does not approve, since she is just a country girl, so the love becomes forbidden love. To be sure, films like this have been done since film began, but this is a great one. You just want these two to be happy. It is tragic, but also sweet and so well put together that it is absorbing and eminently watchable. If you thought you couldn't watch a silent film (much less one with subtitles), try this out. I saw it on TCM, but it is available on DVD. Really, its great.\",\n",
       " \"When many first see this film, they will be surprised when they notice that it is a silent film even though made in 1931. While Hollywood had just about completely switched over to talkies by 1929, several nations still produced silents well into the 1930s--among them France, Japan and China. You really can't hold this against the film, as the studios in China simply didn't have the equipment, money or know-how to make a talking picture.<br /><br />The story of the Peach Girl is rather familiar and I've seen several movies with very similar plots. A rich man falls for a poor girl but their marriage is forbidden. Despite this, the lovers consummate their love and the girl is soon pregnant. When discovered, she is cast out and the young man behaves horribly--only trying to correct his error when it is too late.<br /><br />Because the story is rather familiar (I have seen several variations on this story made in both Japan and China), it is very competently and beautifully done. In addition to lovely cinematography, the recent restoration features an exceptionally nice piano score that really suits the film well. A lovely late silent film.\",\n",
       " 'Made for television movies can never escape the feeling they we\\'re made for television even if they go to the trouble of sticking it in a glossy video box trying their best to mold it as a stand alone product it usually doesn\\'t work. Once your start watching it\\'ll be there -- the taste, the sight and the scent. Ah it\\'s a made for television movie. Now Tom Clancy\\'s Netforce was originally a two part television movie... how little did I know. In fact it\\'s all still somewhat a wash to me. Let me break it down for you.<br /><br />Flash forward to 2005 when the internet has become so powerful and potentially dangerous that the US government sets up a division within the FBI entitled \"Netforce\" to preside and protect over it from the evil people of the world who look to exploit it for their corrupt plans. Personally I seriously disbelieve the internet holds the future of the world in it\\'s hands, but that doesn\\'t matter because even if it did, the people at Netforce couldn\\'t protect it if they had to.<br /><br />Upon meeting the major characters we realize they\\'re roles we\\'ve all seen before. Like the tough male main character who\\'s strong and dresses well. The rest of the cast fit typical molds as you can guess. I especially liked how a certain character\\'s ex-wife is a news reporter who at one point becomes a key piece in the story. Everyone is so linked together. Realistic? No. Then again none of the characters have any real in-depth characterization. They\\'re just names and faces.<br /><br />Making things worse... outside of the main players there\\'s just way too many needless minor secondary characters being thrown around. They add very little if nothing to the story except padding and viewer confusion. It gets hard remembering twenty characters throughout a two and a 1/2 hour movie. Which further shows the weak structure of the story\\'s narrative when the movie spends too much time on them. I want to give the movie credit for trying an attempt at making us care about those insignificant minor characters too, but it even fails at that. We know they\\'ll get whacked sooner or later.<br /><br />Sticking with the cast... I expected more from such an acting ensemble. Scott Bakula gets to look smart in suit -- the key word being \"look\". This project could have benefited from someone with more clout than Bakula. He\\'s sufficient, but that\\'s about it. Meanwhile Kris Kristofferson gets the cliché elder role and good \\'ol Brian Dennehy has been given the plum role as the President\\'s Chief Of Staff. That means him popping up occasionally spewing \\'How his ass is on the line\\' or \\'the President\\'s p***ed at him\\'. OK... so good actors sometimes appear in bad movies and even good actors can\\'t save a bad script. That\\'s a fact. What really bothers me is this product had Tom Clancy\\'s name written all over it yet it isn\\'t anywhere near the quality of his past outings like \"Patriot Games\" or \"Clear and Present Danger\". It\\'s a real disservice. Some of the blame has to fall straight into the writer\\'s lap too. I say this because I find it hard to see this as an adaptation project that started well. It was bad from the get-go. The story stinks. It\\'s like amateur hour. Especially considering how much they squeeze into too little of a time frame. Would more time have had helped? I\\'m hesitant to say. Even with over two hours they still came back with this slop. Frankly 160 minutes is a long time. It\\'s length is precisely what leads to it\\'s failing because there isn\\'t enough depth to sustain a person\\'s interest or the holding of disbelief for such an amount of time. With no real depth behind the characters and a long, boring and downright confusing story, it all becomes just scenes connected together because people that we\\'re in the last scene are in the next.<br /><br />It can\\'t even take itself seriously. Like Judge Reinhold playing the \\'evil multi-billion dollar software tycoon looking to control the world\\' role or how unrealistic and corny it is to have FBI agents point loaded weapons in the faces of innocent cabdrivers. It\\'s things like these that help to make Netforce such a bore. There\\'s absolutely no atmosphere here. Honestly for a film dealing so heavily with computers and the internet, they sure went skimpy enough on the technical aspects too. I guess they didn\\'t want to lose their biggest viewing demographic... computer inept coach potatoes and patriotic Tom Clancy fans.<br /><br />For the movie it\\'s trying to be there is very little (if any) paranoia, suspense or \"edge of your seat excitement\" as so called critics would say. I don\\'t know what you\\'d classify this movie. Definitely not action, nowheres near a thriller, so where does that leave us? Drama, maybe? I don\\'t know. Drama\\'s tend to draw upon a variety of emotions from viewers. This one draws nothing but boredom and in the land of movies that\\'s not exactly new territory. <br /><br />Last thing too. A golden rule of movies. If they don\\'t find a body 95% of the time that\\'s a clear signal the person ain\\'t dead. That\\'s a fact.',\n",

One thing I did notice about NETFORCE is that if I remained ignorant about the internet this TVM wouldn\\'t have appeared so bad to me <br /><br />!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!<br /><br />One thing that really irritated me is how the writers seem to have confused computer technology with an all encompassing thing called \" the internet \" . For example the bad guys are able to gain access to the security systems of a maximum security prison via the internet . What you mean the computerised door locking system must connected to the internet in some way ? We see umpteen examples of this ridiculous thinking that because something is computerised it must be connected to the internet in someway ! No . No . No . Computerised systems and the internet are not the one and the same . For example if the internet collapsed tomorrow computers would still work even if it means you can\\'t send emails or write reviews at the IMDb . I could still use my computer as a word processor or play computer games etc the world wouldn\\'t suddenly revert to the stone age because the internet failed <br /><br />There\\'s also several other blunders which led me to believe that the writers are nowhere near as being smart as their audience . If a computer hacker is deleting his system this can be jammed by sticking a floppy disk in the hard drive ! What a floppy disk ? It\\'s never explained why this stops the system being deleted , perhaps the good guys were carrying a back up copy of the villains system ? We\\'re also told to believe that some real hot internet systems can\\'t be traced because they don\\'t use cookies !

In effect they\\'re a combination of a computer geek and a Delta Force member . Is this logical or realistic ? Why does a member have to be both a computer expert AND an elite law enforcement agent ? Why can\\'t the organisation employ computer wizards to track down rogue computer operators and then send a crack team of commandos to round up the bad guys ?<br /><br />The whole feel of this TVM screams \" TV pilot \" and I don\\'t believe for a moment that Tom Clancey and co didn\\'t toy with the idea that this would end up as a long running series but the flaws are instantly obvious . There\\'s only a certain amount of plots in any genre and this techno thriller lasting three hours has used up all potential plots in one go . Be honest , just how long could you tolerate Scott Bakula as an action hero who spends 50% of an episode typing on a computer , 40% of an episode flirting with his female colleague and 10% of an episode shooting bad guys ?',\n",

Too bad it turned out to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen; the kind that gives me a new-found respect for movies that I thought were bad before. Seriously. This movie is quite possibly the worst movie ever.<br /><br />Where do I start? Let's go with plot. It's unbelievably boring, from start to finish. Not only that, but it's hopelessly confusing, with new characters being introduced every 2 seconds, so you can't keep all of them straight. Plus, the plot is so unrealistic and cheezy, I found myself frequently rolling my eyes. The endless baricade of cliches doesn't help any. I could guess what was coming next at almost every part of the movie.<br /><br />The acting was just plain awful. Everyone did a terrible job of portraying emotions, or lack thereof. It was often hard to tell if they were even trying to do a good job.<br /><br />I wanted to kick the man in charge of filming the movie nearly every other scene. Nearly 75% of the movie is shot with what appears to be an 8mm videocamera rather than movie film. This is probably the biggest mistake, as it only adds to the shoddy atmosphere, making it look like a home movie rather than a commercial production.<br /><br />I never turn off a movie before it is finished, even if it is really bad. This is because there is always the possibility that the movie will suddenly get good, and I fall in love with it (which has happened before quite a few times). Actually, the final action scene was almost half-good. However, it was too little, too late. If the producers of this film expected one semi-decent scene to make up for 3 hours of crap, they are utterly mistaken.<br /><br />Fortunately, some good things can come from this movie. It makes a nifty doorstop, paperweight, and doggy chew toy.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to.. absolutely no one. If you come across a Netforce tape, drop it onto the floor and smash it by jumping on it repeatedly. Afterwards, be sure to grind your heel into it.<br /><br />I give this movie a 1 out of 10.\",\n",

It seems quite a lot of money (for a TV movie) has been thrown at this but the pace at times is down to a crawl and Bakula's character seems to have become head of Netforce with a total lack of any computer knowledge. It's dated fairly badly but all movies about computers do that look at Wargames or Tron! But it's main problems are down to a flabby script, pedestrian direction and lack of tension as for the ending i'm not even going to go there! Let's just say it ain't great, I gave this film a 4/10 as it's not a total lost cause but i cant recommend spending 2+hours watching this when there are better films out there. If you want a hacker movie War Games (Mathew Broderick) or Sneakers (Robert Redford, River Phoenix) are better movies in the same sort of area or for a more MTV friendly teen hacker movie then go for Hackers (Angelina Jolie & Tommy Lee Miller).<br /><br />4/10 - If there's nothing better on a rainy Sunday it might pass the time but thats about all, we can only hope the Quantum Leap movie gets off the ground to save Scott Bakula!\",\n",
       " 'Like many people, I rented this movie as a Clancy fan. I had previously read his book, \"NetForce\", and was eager to see it on the tube. I now deeply regret my decision to see it at all.<br /><br />Not only was the movie a complete waste of time, but its plot was filled with more holes than a bullet-riddled SUV on an A-10 target range, and held about as much water. If somebody asks you where some important aspect of a workable plot went, you could simply reply, \"it fell into a plot hole,\" and that would be the end of it.<br /><br />The entire movie was packed to the gills with bad acting and painfully extreme deviations from what had been the good storyline of the book. Both the original storyline and all the cool action scenes fell into some of the movie\\'s gaping plot holes somewhere in the process of production, and Clancy\\'s interesting and intelligent characters were also conspicuously missing. Neither the plot nor the ending resembled those of the book in any way, and the ever present boredom and disgust of the movie left you emotionally drained to the point where you\\'d wish all the shallow, no-can-act characters would just hurry up and die.<br /><br />I don\\'t write this review to simply be critical of this piece of poorly-conceived garbage, but rather as a warning to all the Clancy fans out there still considering seeing this movie. So here\\'s your warning: To the Clancy fan: whether you\\'ve read the book or not, if are given the opportunity to watch this movie, don\\'t even think about it. You turn around and you RUN AWAY. Run for your life, and don\\'t look back, or you are likely regret it for the rest of your days.',\n",
       " \"We're here! Where's my videophone? This movie is not as bad as some of the critics here say. It is reasonably entertaining, if you can get past the first 15 minutes. It is Tom Clancy, so there is some twists and turns to the plot, which keeps it interesting. I think it is best to compare it to some of the lamer James Bond movies; on that score it looks reasonably good.<br /><br />What was going through my mind as I watched it was that I bet the computer security folks have watched the movie as a warning of what could happen, sort of, if they don't do their job. And I bet some of the hackers watch it with dreams of glory.<br /><br />Obviously, the problems with the Internet described in the movie haven't happened, for the most part, so the movie looks a bit foolish. Actually, I see from the book review that while the novel was written in 1999, it was set in 2010. But we have been learning in the past year or so about the dangers of spyware that abound. In that sense, the premise was remarkably prescient. Corporations just love to get their hands on all sorts of information about you, without your knowledge. And the government is not so different; often they work hand in hand, as in the airline passenger data collection. So the movie, as science fiction, is not entirely far fetched.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Scott Bakula and his great work on Quanum Leap. Frankly, the TV show had better writing, not to mention better cinematography. And the critics who bemoan all the boilerplate about asschewing are right. Another point that bothers me, especially given Clancy's general penchant for veracity, is the absurdity of they guy's wife covering him on the news. No reputable news organization would allow this incest, except perhaps FOX.<br /><br />But the ending is interesting enough to make it all worthwhile.<br /><br />Fans of Ayn Rand should find this movie especially interesting. It follows the same theme as Rand McNally Shrugged. And the quality of writing is about equal. <br /><br />Who is Steve Day???\",\n",

The complete ignorance to the truth of the way computers and the internet work was only one of the poor elements of this film, but it managed to disappoint in every other aspect as well. The story was contrived and uninteresting. The characters were plastic and unconvincing. The manufactured suspense was nothing more than frustrating and annoying. Had there been any research done on the factual basis of this story, there may have been some interesting thread, but as any intelligent person who has even the slightest understanding of how technology or the internet works, this movie is an obvious farce. Even with only the expectation of an average fictional \"techno-phobic\" type story, I was disappointed by the lack of any real original content. Of all my experience of Tom Clancy\\'s work, this is the worst and most disappointing example I have ever encountered. Even on the larger scale, this movie is one of the worst, hopeless, disgraceful, and offensive efforts I have ever had the misfortune to witness and endure. The worst 2 dollars I have ever spent.',\n",

The Hunt for Red October -- the best film adaptation of the Jack Ryan series thus far -- still stands as my favorite film of all time.<br /><br />Like any writer sensing opportunity, Clancy decided to franchise his name to such series as Op Center and Net Force. Op Center was actually a surprisingly \"OK\" TV mini-series, thanks to the efforts of Harry Hamlin and Lindsay Frost. Net Force, however, is a total disaster.<br /><br />It\\'s difficult even to establish blame. While the notion of an Internet investigations division of the FBI sounds appealing (isn\\'t the Secret Service in fact charged with this responsibility?), everything in Op Center is ludicrous. The sophomoric romantic storyline of Bakula and Going, the uber Bill Gates villain played by Judge Reinhold, and the Kris Kristofferson (Can you believe he was in fact a Rhodes Scholar and former Army pilot??) dead mentor with a secret -- all of this just defies conventional wisdom or reality.<br /><br />Without belaboring the point, Net Force is just plain not entertaining.',\n",

       " \"This movie alternated between captivating wine drama and formulaic romance.<br /><br />The wine drama part was held together by the Bill Pullman and Freddy Rodriguez, both excellent. It had beautiful scenery, a love triangle with a pretty girl, an immigrant story, and maybe half a dozen colorful side characters. All ingredients of a good movie.<br /><br />But then the master craftsmen in charge of this masterpiece added the final ingredient -- namely the entire catalog of Hollywood romantic-adventure-drama-comedy cliché's. Something like Coyote Ugly, but in wine country. <br /><br />That's it in a nutshell. With a few bottles it becomes fun movie, but not quite film festival worthy. Don't know what they were thinking at Sundance, I'm giving it a 4 (BYOB).\",\n",
       " \"Sorry folks, but I had some real problems with the movie. I thought the cinematography and audio were great. However, I was not happy with the writing and directing. I didn't find Bill Pullman's character very believable. They just tried too hard to make him look like a character and in the end, I only had disbelief (not suspended). The character of Bo Barrett was meant to be a sympathetic character, but didn't come across as one to me. The love triangle in the movie just seemed old fashioned. Why must the white guy always end up with the white girl? There was good reason to fall in love with Gustavo, he made good wine and he exhibited heart. But I saw little reason for her to fall in love with Bo. At one point she tells him (and us) that Bo has heart, but I didn't see much of it. Near the end, it looks like he's trying harder, but it just seemed so contrived. Bo came across as an empty-headed, blonde for the first half of the movie and it was hard to believe that he developed passion in the end.<br /><br />In the end, I was also not happy about how the actual competition was portrayed. Why would any substantial French wine experts attend the first year of a competition setup by an ex-patriot Brit wine seller with no customers? If there was a good reason, it was never presented. It just didn't seem credible.<br /><br />This is a movie that should be remade. I like the story and I'd like to see it done right.\",\n",
       " \"This is not a good movie\\x85for many reasons: poor script, bad conception, spotty acting, incompetent technical delivery, etc. etc. We only saw this turkey because there was a mix-up (oops! on IMDb) in the theatre schedule which meant we would have to wait an additional half hour for our desired film (to remain nameless). We should have waited. There is so much wrong with this film, it is hard to know where to start. Let me turn this around then and begin with what I liked: Alan Rickman's performance, especially in his strange little talks with Dennis Farina in the former's wine shop. That's all.<br /><br />A few specifics in the bad film department: Most of the other acting was ho-hum or worse, including Chris Pine (too much time on screen) and his so-called romantic interest played by Rachael Taylor. To be fair to the latter, her character was a walking cliché who, instead of developing a relationship with the Freddie Rodriguez role, which might have been interesting, falls inevitably into the arms of Mr. Pine. Did I mention racism as another problem? So Rodriguez is wasted, as well as Ms. Dushku, who seems to exist primarily as an obvious and lame plot mechanism.<br /><br />Writing this is making me angry all over again, so for our collective health, I will end this by lighting into the cinematography, which was lazy and badly staged (my viewing mate spent the film counting technical mistakes because it was so poorly made), giving us little sense of the actual locations where the main action was taking place. The characters could have been anywhere \\x96 and wound up nowhere, just like the viewing audience who hated it as much as I did.\",\n",
       " \"Unfortunately, this movie falls prey to an overwrought treatment of what many would consider to be a still esoteric, but increasingly popular, subject. With its formulaic and simplistic narrative of California's burgeoning wine culture, the characters are stereotypical; and were portrayed in a manner that we would expect from the more industrial-minded aspects of Hollywood.<br /><br />Despite these faults, it was pleasurable to watch Rickman portray Mr. Spurrier, whose work today within the wine world is often admirable. For those reviewers that did not see the film, such as fellow reviewer Luisinho Biker (who made a reference to a war \\x96 I am uncertain what this has to do with anything), the importance of the Judgment of Paris was more than just beneficial to American vintners. It also showed that French winemakers may have been resting on their laurels, and had not reevaluated how they had been producing wine. Many nations, including the United States, realized that winemaking could be approached using new techniques while still adhering to terroir and tradition. Of course, there is not a best wine. A better movie may show that wine is a deeply faceted staple that can be interpreted in many ways. Perhaps the up-coming Judgment of Paris will highlight the depth of oenology and those that enjoy its fruits.\",\n",

And how many times can they cut to the father/son boxing each other.. <br /><br />But it all comes down to a boring script that just drags along instead of someone editing half the movie out..and moving forward past the Paris contest.. which is sad because this story could have been so much more but as they always say.. it's the script, script, script... and this one sticks with no connection to the characters it is so flat. <br /><br />I almost walked out if it had it not been for the brief moments of the Paris moments with Rickman/Farina.. yet the California ones were unbearable.. and im a wine lover that thought perhaps they would create some decent moments but nothing... And poor Bill Pullman did the best he could but these young actors should go back to soap operas and stay away from film and the director stick to TV directing or commercials.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 because i had to buy my friend a glass of wine to revive him after falling asleep halfway thru the movie after yet another car breaks down to create some suspense.. yawwwwwnnnnnn!!!!<br /><br />Oh and how about the girl watering down the tackle... yeah.. real nice sexist wanna be playboy soft porn... truly embarrassing!\",\n",
       " \"I stuck with this movie because (1) I hoped to learn more about wine making (2) the photography was A+ and as a travelogue it was was enlightening.<br /><br />But almost every scene in California seemed to have been written by a teen-ager who knew only cute. Or perhaps someone wearing pink lensed glasses. Sweet is the word for this movie. Overly sweet. Saccharine. <br /><br />Ramshackle cars and trucks on their last legs trucks predominate, showing us that everyone is on their last nickle. A young girl-intern lives in a cabin right out of Hans Christian Anderson. The art director and whoever built the cabin must have been living out a childhood fairy tale. It was a perfect cabin, perched on a little hill-top, in the midst of miles of grape vines, under the heavenly blue sky usually seen on Hallmark greeting cards. Only Toto was missing.<br /><br />On the other hand the moment that Alan Rickman and Denis Farina get to work, I felt like they brought their own writer. Funny, intelligent, and engaging, most of their scenes were fine. Although someone thought that Farina wasn't quite enough of a character so he was constantly dressed in very noisy sport jackets, ones that may have been cut from some surplus horse blankets. -- More cuteness, I guess. Also, he's given an Elvis pompadour to wear -- Farina is a strong enough character on his own, he doesn't need any props to make him more than he is on his own. maybe the director is insecure or never learned that less is more. <br /><br />Everything in this movie is too cute and over sugared. There is the usual father-son conflict. There is actually a boxing ring set up on the verge of the vineyard so that Dad and son can go to it in the ring.I know you don't believe me--but you'll see it when you get to this film. <br /><br />The writers and directors must have been classmates at the California College of Cliché.\",\n",

However, Fate steps in with a most peculiar fantasy figure (of her imagination it seems) she names George (Cornel Wilde), who creates compromising situations in her life yet gradually points the way out for her bewilderment.<br /><br />When she recalls an old sweetheart from childhood days, Johnny, who is now a fireman (also played by Cornel Wilde), she realizes he\\'s the one for her but there are many tangled threads to set aright.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie is amusing but picks up momentum as it progresses and becomes downright hilarious. I found it very funny where Victoria bursts out in confusion, \"But I\\'m going to marry Oliver,\" (or words to that effect) as if trying to convince herself. It reminds me of that saying, \"The heart has reasons that reason does not understand.\"<br /><br />It\\'s an enjoyable movie with a surprising twist to the ending.

Got a little weird for me, but I guess if you don\\'t look too closely, you can just go along for the ride. This was one of Ginger\\'s comedies, like Stage Door, Monkey Business.

It shouldn\\'t be taken too seriously as it is a fantasy piece. You will have to suspend your sense of reality to enjoy this. But that\\'s the point.<br /><br />At the heart of this story is the idea that we all have one true love we are destined to be with. Call it Fate, Destiny, or even God-ordained - but it\\'s the notion that forces will conspire to put us in touch with our one and only soul-mate.<br /><br />This movie reminds me of another one of my favorite contemporary movies, Serendipity(2001), in the sense of being destined to find our soul-mate (although it is not a fantasy piece). I think guys probably find the fantasy, imaginary friend notion of IHTBY a little too corny for their tastes. But if you like a good, cheesy romance story, then you should like this picture.<br /><br />I\\'ve notice several reviewers criticize Rogers for her little girl, squeaky voice. But I think in this role, it enhances the story. If you look at it from the idea that she is like a little girl who has never really grown up - but is somewhat frozen in time to back when she was 6 years old, when she first meets her \"soul-mate\". I know this is a stretch, but that is how I interpreted it and it worked for me.<br /><br />I love the sets and costumes in this movie. It makes for a visual feast. Rogers\\' gowns are unbelievably gorgeous, especially the wedding gown at the very end. But even her dressing gowns were quite elaborate, adding to the notion of just how wealthy her family is. I find it hard to believe women actually wore these - they look incredibly uncomfortable! If the beautiful mansion set with the incredible staircase looks familiar, you may recognize it from Holiday (1938), the George Cukor film starring Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. That staircase is just amazing - the most beautiful I have ever seen.<br /><br />There is one thing I did find hard to swallow, and I didn\\'t notice it until Rogers and Wilde are in the car and he finally decides to marry her. How did he not notice the huge, honking diamond engagement ring on her finger and not know she was already engaged? Also, look closely at Wilde\\'s left ring finger in this scene as well.

Its humor carries through 60 years later and the actors felt right for their roles. Also, the story is believable in its unbelievability - I still like to think my kindergarten-crush will pop up and be right for me.<br /><br />The movie also has that post-war wholesomeness that\\'s hard to describe.

Like the film RUNAWAY BRIDE, Ginger plays a woman who uses men--leaving them again and again at the alter. All this is intended to be kooky, but I found myself hating her character from the start due to her selfishness and whiny voice. I honestly would have loved it if one of her many fiancés had just slugged her! While all this wasn\\'t very promising and Ginger\\'s performance was VERY broad and \"kooky\", the film abruptly got worse while she was on a train trip. During her dream, she imagined an American Indian beau (played by Cornell Wilde) and when she awoke, he was real and pursued her rabidly. Some of his lines were admittedly funny, but this plot wore thin almost as soon as it began.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the better (and this isn\\'t saying much) acts in the film was the part played by Ron Randell--as a very, very effeminate and ineffectual boyfriend. He wasn\\'t that good, but compared to Rogers and Wilde, he looked like Olivier! Try watching this tedious film if you\\'d like, but understand that I am a huge fan of classic Hollywood films and I really wanted to like this movie--which came off like a bad episode of GILLIGAN\\'S ISLAND.

Her reaction is not immediate, and she simply replies \"I don\\'t know; I love you with it but I\\'ve never known you without it.\" So while Agnès leaves the apartment for a short time to do some shopping, Marc takes the risk and cuts off his beloved moustache, just like that, in order to see his lover\\'s face and analyze her reaction when she returns home. <br /><br />However, Marc will be severely disappointed: upon Agnès\\' arrival, she does not utter one single word. She seems not to notice the major physical change in Marc\\'s face. Nor do their friends. Even Marc\\'s colleagues at the office fail to perceive the absence of his moustache. Is he on the verge of madness? Or has he become the target of a massive conspiracy triggered by his own girlfriend? More weirdly, did he even ever have a moustache? Or was it part of some unexplainable imagination? Marc has no clue at all how to react to his baffling new situation\\x85 <br /><br />When you enter the official movie website, a big question mark appears at the end of the flash intro. This question mark is totally appropriate, since it clearly illustrates what kind of movie \\'La Moustache\\' really is: namely a confusing, puzzling drama with an open ending and a number of unexplainable twists, flashbacks and mysterious appearances by characters when you least expect it. \"What is \\'La Moustache\\' about?\" is the first question of a recent online interview conducted with Emmanuel Carrère. The director himself has no answer to that crucial question. <br /><br />Indeed, \\'La Moustache\\' is one of these attention-grabbing cinematic mysteries that first baffle the spectators, and then leave them behind with a bunch of questions unanswered. There are though, in this ingeniously structured and passionately filmed movie, some easily detectable themes. For once, \\'La Moustache\\' is an analysis of a dysfunctional couple tumbling into a conflict driven by mistrust. Marc soon accuses Agnès of plotting against him, but Agnès is deeply persuaded that Marc has in fact never had a moustache. This marks the beginning of a series of violent arguments and disputes. <br /><br />Moreover, Carrère\\'s film closely focuses on a man struggling with the inevitable loss of his personal identity. Marc is unable to distinguish between reality and imagination, and so he struggles hard to uncover the origins of the problem. He is a man all on his own against the rest of the world. In his apartment, he finds some old pictures from a vacation in Bali, all of them showing him with a moustache. But is he really the only one to see it? Is the moustache on this photo real or not? He does not know, and we do not either. <br /><br />Especially the first part of \\'La Moustache\\' is intensely compelling and dark, examining the relationship between Marc and Agnès, and closely focusing on Marc\\'s progressive battle to keep his emotional and moral nature under control. When his consciousness slowly begins to shut down, the tension mounts as the suspense grows and the atmosphere becomes more and more threatening. Carrère has a brilliant vision, and he captures Marc\\'s way into madness in a diverse and appealing way. <br /><br />Marc is the perfect role for Vincent Lindon, whose look is continually as puzzling as the story itself. He masters his role with ideal perfection, always acting authentically. The same can be said about the brilliant Emmanuelle Devos (\\'La Femme de Gilles\\'), who delivers an enigmatic performance as Agnès. Her complex character is a true object of curiosity, and no one can trust her. Is she the evil woman ruining the mind of her partner? Or is she the reasonable person? Question marks à gogo. <br /><br />The last twenty minutes of \\'La Moustache\\', which follow Marc to Bangkok, where he repetitively embarks and disembarks ferries all day long, are quite debatable, yet very challenging. The film reaches yet another climax, takes another abrupt twist, and once again challenges us spectators by sparking our curiosity. Please do not expect a satisfying explanation towards the very ending, because \\'La Moustache\\' ain\\'t going to give you one. Many pieces of the puzzle remain untraceable; but that\\'s exactly what makes this masterpiece so intriguing and unique. (Grade: B+)',\n",
       " '\"The Moustache\" is a comedy that, starting from the most trivial of pretexts, quickly turns into a true Kafkian nightmare. A man shaves his mustache. No one seems to notice, and in a surrealistic parody of male mid-life crisis this causes conflict, pain and uncertainty. But more and more threads come undone in the fabric of his reality.<br /><br />Excellent self-adaptation of a short novel by Emmanuel Carrère, La Moustache delivers the spectator with much more than it promises, in these days a rare occurrence indeed. Vincent Lindon as the troubled protagonist is good and measured, and the movie has an excellent pace and nothing is overdone. Even the theme, a Philip Glass \"Concerto pour violon et orchestre\" could not be more effective. Will we ever see this movie in the USA? Maybe in a parallel reality.',\n",
       " \"Read the book some time ago and after watching the movie felt much the same sort of existential exhilaration - if there is such a thing. Maybe it was just the cold that I have, though. A little overacted at times, but otherwise like an exotic episode of the Twilight Zone, shot in glorious colour. The film reminded me another French film I saw in the theatre recently by the name of Cache, which I enjoyed very much. As for it's American counterpart, I suppose that you'd be looking at something like Lost Highway, David Lynch's bizarre account of a modern, urban couple trying to grapple with the unknown. This seems to be something of a genre for the French and they are quite good at pulling it off - as is evidenced with this film - with considerable style and enough depth of plot and character to leave you considering and reconsidering the film for far more than the sadly customary 10 minutes. <br /><br />I almost shaved my beard off after watching it just to see what would happen. But I haven't yet. Or have I?\",\n",
       " \"This movie is a prime example of how the simplest things can mushroom out of control. Architect Marc (Vincent Lindon) has had a moustache since he was knee high to a blueprint and it is, he feels, part of him, then he takes it into his head to speculate on just how much he is identified via the moustache. He starts by asking his live-in lover Agnes (Manu Devos) whether she would still fancy him sans moustache; since she's only known him with it she can't answer. So, out comes the razor and THEN comes the uneasiness that segues into genuine fright. Not only does Devos not notice the difference but neither do their friends and his colleagues at work. We are now on the fringes of a Kafkaesque scenario which isn't really resolved satisfactorily. For reasons that eluded me Marc, by now convinced that Devos has some hidden agenda he can't fathom, lights out for Hong Kong literally in just the clothes he stands up in and spends a few days - weeks, months? - riding the ferry before Devos shows up, or does she? For one thing how did she know where he was and/or track him down to the fleabag where's he's taken a room. Lots of food for thought here and the acting is out of the right bottle if anybody asks you.\",\n",
       " 'wow ! this movie is great ! If what you want is to be an active spectator and interactive with the movie, you\\'ll not be disappointed. You\\'ll try to think about what you see and try to solve this whole strange piece of art. <br /><br />Its about the choices that we make (small choices as to deceide yes or no to cut the moustache) and what are the consequences on our life and the impact toward us by the people we know. Am I important to their eyes even if they are called friends, will they notify any difference on our life. It\\'s also about the search of our identity, and how our identity becomes the one of the other in a relashionship with a lover. <br /><br />You choose what ever is the meaning of this movie but I believe the director has it\\'s own precise explanation about every detail. I have my own, I think most of the movie is imagination of the character, and the only reality scenes are the ones where he walks everyday in the metro of Hong-Kong, depressed after his wife would have left him during the vacations in Hong-Kong, where he shave his moustache. Even those vacations are a little bit transformed mentally by the reconstitution, it\\'s a flash-back, and all the scenes in Paris are imagination of a life he would have had with his wife if they would have stayed together, with constantly rethinking of his choice of shaving the moustache. It\\'s like Hanneke\\'s \"Caché\" or more like Lynch\\'s \"Mulholland Drive\". We travel into the infinite spiral of the human spirit, everything is interior and subjective. The music of Philip Glass is sublime and will obsess you. <br /><br />You won\\'t forget this movie, even if you don\\'t like it.',\n",
       " 'The premise for \"La Moustache\" should be enough to grab the attention of any film fanatic, especially one who gets thrills from the psychological twists perpetrated upon an audience by the likes of Hitchcock and those he inspired. The film begins simply enough with a man in the bath, inquiring of his wife whether or not he should shave off his mustache. Soon enough he\\'s rid himself of that same lip hair, and no one seems to notice. In fact, maybe he never even had the thing in the first place. How genius a premise, right? The minutiae of daily life are oft overlooked subject matter, so it\\'s refreshing to see something so basic given major importance. Things go along smoothly enough as the man starts to come unwound due to this, but then what? By the time the end credits roll, certain thoughts are running wildly through the mind of the audience. It goes back to wondering just how much can be perpetrated upon an audience before they are either too stumped to get it, or too mentally manipulated to care. This is an interesting film worth a peek, and possibly a discussion about its genius or likewise about where it goes sadly astray.',\n",
       " \"At first, through the first third of the movie, I was sure that the film was an allegory about the architect's family and friends never actually noticing him (or his moustache). Things got confusing to me when he didn't press his wife about the Bali photographs (which appear to confirm he's NOT crazy), his wife is apparently trying to have him committed and he suddenly escapes to Hong Kong.<br /><br />Though I did enjoy the film immensely in all its detail, I kept feeling there must have been a link between his moustache (and the identity crisis shaving it off led to) and his father's death. His father's death seemed to have discombobulated him.<br /><br />Did his own confusion about his moustache symbolize his inability to digest the death of his father? Was he dreaming all of the confusion about his moustache?<br /><br />In the end, I'm left with questions only. Nonetheless, I did enjoy this film and would like to know what other people think of it and what they make of it.\",\n",
       " 'This review reveals almost everything about this story. So, if you want to enjoy the mystery first, then stop right now...and come back after you\\'ve seen the film.<br /><br />The title is classic misdirection by writers. This story has nothing specific to do with a moustache. It is merely a symbol used to highlight the idea of identity and, more particularly, the extent to which a husband and wife are aware of each other.<br /><br />The story is as follows: the fade in opens with a successful Parisian businessman, Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon), shaving off his moustache while having a bath. When confronting his wife, Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) she fails to evince any surprise. Somewhat puzzled \\x96 because, only a few moments prior, Agnes had said how much she liked his moustache \\x96 Marc says nothing but continues on to a dinner engagement to Serge and Nadia Schaeffer (Mathieu Amalric and Marcha Polikarpova) where they all say nothing about his new look. Later, suspecting a trick, Marc confronts Agnes at their apartment where she categorically denies Marc has ever had a moustache...<br /><br />Oooops!<br /><br />Dumbfounded, Marc has a troubled sleep but goes to work the next morning, convinced that Agnes and their so-called friends are out to get him, for some unknown reason. At the office and the nearby coffee shop \\x96 where Marc has dined all too often \\x96 the same situation persists: nobody makes any comment about the absence of his moustache.<br /><br />Hence, for Marc, the puzzle worsens...<br /><br />He begins to panic: he searches for the remains of his moustache in the garbage; he seeks confirmation from a stranger that a photo, from a 2003 holiday in Bali, shows him with a moustache. But, later that day, he asks Agnes to cancel a lunch with his parents - and she replies that his father died a year earlier! Questioning her further, Marc realizes with mounting horror, that she cannot even recall their friends, Serge and Nadia!<br /><br />What\\'s going on here? Am I crazy, thinks Marc? Confused and shattered, he falls into a stupor and sleeps again, allowing Agnes to slip a knock-out Mickey Finn to him. Hours later he wakes to hear Agnes and Bruno (Hippolyte Giradou), his office associate, discussing plans to have him committed to an asylum. Frantic, Marc runs off to find his parents, but is unable to contact them, and calls Agnes to meet him, while watching from a taxi. After she leaves with Bruno, Marc quickly gets his passport, a coat and money, and goes to the airport where he boards a flight for...Hong Kong!<br /><br />When he gets there, he wanders around a bit, alternately ferrying from Hong Kong to Kowloon and back a few times \\x96 a great metaphor for his indecision - then pays his way onto a coastal trader to finally wind up at an un-named coastal village. He wanders off from the boat and ends up at a run-down hotel where he pays for a room and falls asleep, exhausted...<br /><br />Okay \\x96 stop right here: all of the above is Marc\\'s dream \\x96 or nightmare, I guess.<br /><br />The next (real) scene, we see Marc, unshaven with many weeks growth, wolfing down noodles at a local restaurant. After the meal, he wanders back to the hotel where he finds (and, as the viewer, we also find) Agnes packing their bags to return to Paris. She tells him to shave off his growing beard and suggests he also remove his moustache. When he does so, she remarks how much it suits him. They go to bed; they make love; she sleeps. Marc lies there for a long while, eyes closed. Then, he opens his eyes wide, blankly and silently screaming: am I awake or is this a dream? Fade to black...<br /><br />So, here\\'s the real story: Marc and Agnes are on holiday, near Hong Kong, where he hopes to resurrect what he thinks is their dead or dying marital and sexual relationship. One night, he has a nightmare about his innermost fears and desires. The next morning, fortuitously, Agnes suggests he change his image, more or less in keeping with his prior dream, and so he does. Happily for Marc, she actually notices the difference and things appear to be better. Unhappily, however, aspects of his dream remain, most particularly, a post card that he wrote out in his dream. Or did he?<br /><br />Hence, when Marc stares into the darkness, is it truly reality? This is where the writer/director weaves two fundamental issues together: first, there is the male angst about whether his wife still loves him - which generates the bizarre dream set in Paris (while they are both on holiday in China) and second, there is the deeper philosophical issue about reality itself. As the final scene very slowly fades to black, the camera fixes on Marc\\'s troubled eyes, the unspoken question screaming at us: am I in a dream now, or have I woken up? So, does Agnes truly love me, or no?<br /><br />That\\'s for you and all of us to decide...<br /><br />When you see the movie, watch out for the clues that tell you it\\'s all a dream: as the credits roll, there are city lights on dark water \\x96 water heavily connoting sex \\x96 with a sampan just in view; a long column of lights from skyscraper \\x96 a phallic symbol, much repeated later in the story; the photos from Bali, every lover\\'s dream destination. As they drive to the dinner date with Serge and Nadia, Agnes makes a shocking admission to Marc about the way she dresses; at work, Marc is so confused, he says to himself: \"I must be dreaming!\" And, just when Marc leaves to go to work, Agnes calls him back and says: \"Marc \\x96 this is like a bad trip!\"<br /><br />Some trip! See how you like it...',\n",
       " 'Marc decides, before he and his wife Agnes go to dinner at friends, to shave his mustache. He says nothing about it, expecting Agnes to comment on it, but she doesn\\'t seem to notice. And neither do their friends. And neither do his co-workers. And Marc is quietly freaking out. Finally, he breaks down & says something to Agnes, who says he never HAD a mustache, and every one else that he\\'s expected to notice tells him the same thing. Marc, however, becomes somewhat obsessed with proving that he DID have a mustache, which worries those around him until he\\'s asked to seek help. He\\'s even produced pictures of them on vacation with him with his mustache, but Agnes never really looks at them & later they\\'ve disappeared to, and Agnes denies they ever vacationed in that place to begin with.<br /><br />But things get even stranger as Marc is to have lunch with Agnes at his parents the next day, & his father has called to remind him, only to have Agnes tell him that his father\\'s been dead for some time. And their friends that they had dinner with recently? Where\\'d they go? Did they never exist? Marc, of course, is getting more & more agitated & Agnes drugs him when he goes to lie down for a while...Marc comes to just in time to hear Agnes & his boss, Bruno, talking about \"the men in the white coats\" that are coming to take Marc away, and using all his conscience strength to dress himself & make ready, he manages to bolt & impulsively takes a flight to Hong Kong, where he rides the ferries and wanders, eventually taking a room.<br /><br />And the film gets weirder from there. I don\\'t quite know how to categorize this film...a dark comedy/psychological thriller? Maybe..it is very interesting and pretty darn good though, even though you never really know what you\\'ve just witnessed. Is it a conspiracy? Is Marc losing his mind? Or is it just a strange dream?

Nearly all of Dick\\'s work concerned the shifting nature of Identity and the ontological basis for Reality.

In a sense, the film is kind of a Black Comedy, in that such a minor adjustment would not seem to lead to such dislocation. But, that is not the case in La Moustache.

I\\'ve watched some pretty challenging and experimental films that leave a LOT hanging, and I love them! Try El Topo sometime. There are more mainstream ones too like Naked Lunch, or Brazil. These films do not have nice tidy plot lines where everything makes sense -- they are still brilliant films.<br /><br />The difference in the case of \"La Moustache\" is that while this film also happens to lack nice tidy plot lines, the film-makers seemed to think that that, all by itself, makes this film brilliant too.<br /><br />I have never before seen a film that was so elitist, so vapid, and so disrespectful of its audience in assuming it is more clever than they are.

       " 'La Moustache opens with a man thinking about possibly shaving his moustache. There are theories in both spiritual and scientific circles that postulate that whenever we make a decision like this we in fact make them both. We \"filter\" out the decision that we \"didn\\'t\" make and continue to live our normal seemingly-linear life, but another reality exists, just as real as \"this\" one, in which we made the \"other\" decision.<br /><br />To understand this movie in a multiple-timeline context, we have to back up to the beginning of the main character\\'s adult life (before the movie starts), in which he made the decision to grow a moustache at all. In timeline A he never grew one, in timeline B he always grew one since he could. The movie thus begins in timeline B. To keep things simple, let\\'s pretend there are only these two timelines to worry about.<br /><br />The movie opens with the main character making the decision to shave his moustache. In one reality, timeline B, he keeps it. We don\\'t see this reality for the next week or so of his life. Instead, the decision to shave his moustache is so jarring that he \"jumps\" to timeline A, or more accurately he jumps to timeline A but elements of timeline B are still known to him, such as the photographs of his vacation, the license in his wallet, and his overall consciousness and memories are still from timeline B. Most of the movie, however, takes place in timeline A.<br /><br />The fact that he is caught between timelines is psychologically disturbing to him and his wife, neither of whom understand the predicament he is in, and assume that he is either going crazy or, as he assumes at times, someone may be playing an elaborate prank on him.<br /><br />Overhearing that his wife might send him to a mental institution, he escapes to Hong Kong. He immediately misses his wife and writes a postcard to her that he will be back by the time she gets it, but doesn\\'t mail it. He takes a ferry from the city side to the airport side of a river, but before boarding the plane, changes his mind again and goes back on the ferry. Then he _keeps on_ going back and forth across the ferry until the end of the day when it closes. He never does go back to the airport.<br /><br />The ferry riding is a very interesting element in the film. A decision - the decision to shave his moustache, was done hastily in the beginning of the film. Again, another decision, to not get on the plane and get back on the ferry, was made quickly. Was he perhaps trying to \"trick time\" into getting him back into the right timeline? Or is the ferry simply a way to experience the same space over and over again - a \"sameness\" - that is in fact \"different\" every time (every time he rides the ferry there are new people, and he sits in a different place, etc. Even the chairs on the ferry seem to have adjustable backs on them that can swing one way or another, so that the rider can make a decision to face backwards or forwards. Only the ticket seller is the same, and she never seems to recognize him or wonder why he is riding back and forth) Normally we experience sameness (e.g. going to work) that can seem very much the same every time (same co-workers, similar work, etc.) and the ferry is a break from that. Or does the ferry \"between\" the city and the airport represent his state of \"betweenness\" of the timelines? He doesn\\'t want to go back to France, where they might put him in an institution, but he doesn\\'t want to go to his Hong Kong hotel, where he will be missing his wife. He decides to stay \"between\" for this day, and he seems content in this between-ness. He doesn\\'t seem that nervous or worried on the ferry. He is cordial, even smiling to teenage schoolgirls that are giggling at him. He is learning to be OK with betweenness.<br /><br />The movie then jumps to what seems like days later (or perhaps even longer) and the main character now has a moustache grown out. The moustache being present is the catalyst to get him back to timeline B, and when he gets back to his hotel his wife his there, and it is as if she has been there the whole time, with him, on vacation.<br /><br />That night he asks if she would like to see him without a moustache, and she says that she might like to have him try it. This is a different answer than at the opening of the movie, where she says that she has never seen him without it, and she doesn\\'t seem to be that into the idea of him shaving it. He shaves the moustache, but stays in timeline B. Perhaps this time the move is not so jarring because he has done it before. Or perhaps it is because his wife seems more approving this time while they are happy on vacation. Or perhaps it is because he has learned to live in and accept \"betweenness\" after his experience on the ferry. All is well. Or is it? As the lights dim in the room, the viewer is wondering if he will wake up in timeline A all alone.',\n",
       " 'At face value LA MOUSTACHE appears to be an exercise in far-fetched, existential conceit. The trailer certainly doesn\\'t allow a prospective viewer any more information than its premise: a man shaves off his moustache in an effort to change his image. His girlfriend doesn\\'t notice. As a matter of fact... no one does. He begins to get increasingly disturbed that no one would notice something as elemental as facial hair... and then things suddenly spiral out of control.<br /><br />Certainly it would make anyone think: \"Come on, now. A thriller about a man losing his mind because no one has noticed he shaved his moustache off? Isn\\'t this taking it a little too far?\" The truth of the matter is, it\\'s not -- LA MOUSTACHE is merely a set-up in the most elusive of ways, creeping up on the viewer like the best of the Polanski apartment thrillers (where nothing is as it seems) -- and it sends the hapless Marc (Vincent Lindon) into a world that doubles in on itself one-fold, two-fold, while seeming chillingly normal.<br /><br />Maybe it\\'s a commentary on the dangers of being too wealthy (because had we had a struggling couple, something as banal as a moustache wouldn\\'t even enter the picture). Marc and Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) live what can be called a life in the lap of luxury in a sleek loft apartment. They seem to be elementally happy, until one minor, laughably trivial incident throws them into an increasingly jarring descent into marital alienation of the likes of the unhappy couple in George Cukor\\'s GASLIGHT with the genders switched, which grows creepier as Marc suddenly becomes suspicious of everything around him and wonders if events in his life have even occurred. Because as simple as that, from the denial of a moustache\\'s existence, now his own is in peril.<br /><br />And from here on, the story manages to go into uncharted territory, and giving more details about it would be essentially spoiling the fun that this very suppressed, very elegant thriller is. LA MOUSTACHE is an intriguing puzzle in some ways akin to the puzzle of CACHE, where another couple\\'s happiness becomes ensnared in an intrigue that may or may not be happening. Sparse, deliberate while not being too slow (yet not revealing too much too soon), this is a high-concept thriller that should be seen.',\n",
       " \"LA MOUSTACHE is a very well acted and conceived Belgian film that starts with a terrific premise that could be the opening for either a comedy or a drama and ends up wondering which path to take. Writer/director Emmanuel Carrère (with co-script writer Jérôme Beaujour) takes us on a mind trip that becomes increasingly disorienting and frustrating as the film progresses. It challenges the audience to think but then there is no payoff for the effort.<br /><br />Marc (Vincent Lindon) is a handsome middle aged man married to Agnès (Emmanuelle Devos) for fifteen years and one morning, in what in retrospect is in response to a bit of relationship ennui, decides to shave off his mustache which has always been present since his marriage began. The surprise to Marc is that Agnès doesn't even notice. At work Marc quietly shows up and no one notices, not even his close associate Bruno (Hippolyte Girardot). Marc is at first perplexed, then he confronts his wife and fellow workers with the fact that he just shaved off his mustache and no one believes that he ever had one! Marc begins to search for photos showing his previous face and gradually the photos disappear and his wife denies ever seeing them, ever traveling to Bali where the photos were taken, etc. People begin to wonder about Marc's sanity and his wife suggests he seek psychiatric care. It is at this point that Marc enters a fugue state and ultimately disappears to Hong Kong on a never ending quest for discovering the truth about who he really is, whether he actually exists, whether he is the pawn in a cosmic game....it just gets more ludicrous.<br /><br />Both Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos are superb in this peculiar roles and the film has solid production values. Perhaps it is the director's point to leave the audience in a confused state, one that calls forth the existential questions, but as a film it merely peters out, leaving the viewer a bit frustrated by the lack of substance.

       " 'One day a middle-aged architect of Paris suddenly cuts off his mustache, but his surrounding claim he has never had one. Somebody is wrong, and since nobody shares his opinion, he has to escape to Hongkong from the forced mental treatment. Here, in the meantime, he cuts again his regrown mustache, and because this time the change was recognized by his wife, they, again, find each other. What is this film all about? Perhaps about the importance of the everyday matters of no significance, which can still, somehow, ruin our life. About whether we really know each other, listen to each other or even our closest relationships are superficial? Or are we a witness of a disintegration of an instable personality? There is a short-story with the same title \\x84Moustache\" written by the French novelist, Maupassant in 1883, which can elucidate a different way of interpretation. The story is a real ode to the mustache by a fictitious lady. But one can read about other interesting things in that letter \\x84 And mainly I adore mustache because it is French, pure-blooded French wear. We inherited it from our Gallic ancestors, and deserve it, like the symbol of our national character.\" From this point, the saucy mustache of our hero becomes the last symbol of a national identity. He and his wife live a life of a typical citizen of a Western world in the multicultural Paris. They prefer sushi to French food, travel Bali for holiday, and buy Chinese dresses and trinkets in Hongkong. His close surrounding, his wife and his friends, do not even notice the change caused by the disappearance of his mustache, but from an objective point of view (policewoman) the difference is obvious. The past is coming to an end, which is presented by the death of his father, and the vain search of the house of his childhood. This necessarily leads to the development of a split personality: is it himself who is insane or the others? Is he a victim of a conspiracy, or is he suffer from persecution mania? The never-ending ferry-boat journey between two coasts representing a loss of his footing, and the spin of the drum of a washing machine in his dream (head) becomes a symbol of a brainwash. This film is a story about a man who has lost his national identity, and if there is a chance to get it back. There is no answer but perhaps he has to travel to the other part of the world to make even his wife understand; yes there is something what we have lost, but it is good as it is. Still, the last picture is quite worrying: a man without a mustache is lying in a dark sleeplessness, like in a grave.',\n",

I don\\'t know what the people who talk about it being \"suspenseful\" are thinking, because this movie moves like grass growing.

At first, it\\'s no big deal, but later the man becomes angry--how could they be so self-absorbed that they didn\\'t notice or care?! Oddly, when confronted, they have no recollection that he had one, even though the audience saw he had one and saw pictures of the man with the mustache! This part of the film was interesting and pulled me in very well.<br /><br />However, out of the blue, the man disappears to Hong Kong and from then on the plot really makes no sense at all. At first, I thought I\\'d missed something when the film ended--there were just too many dangling plot points and things that just confused me. So, I watched the \"making of featurette\" on the DVD and one of the main characters confided that she read the script and she was also confused and it made no sense. Some people might like this and normally I don\\'t mind a film that leaves unanswered questions, but this goes way beyond this to just confusing and...well, stupid. It took a film that might have earned a 7 or 8 and made it, at best, a 4.<br /><br />Decent acting but a bad script sink this film. But, like so many sub-par films, the DVD case made it sound amazing and worthwhile with phrases like \"A paranoid thriller in the manner of Alfred Hitchcock\" or \"...a mini-masterwork\". Yeah, right. The film had little to do with Hitchcock\\'s style and comparisons to Hitchcock are a dime a dozen. Many of Chabrol\\'s films (even his bad ones) are also often compared to Hitchcock\\'s and I\\'m getting sick of this disingenuous advertising. One of the very few films that might really deserve this comparison is the original LES DIABOLIQUES. In contrast, LA MOUSTACHE seemed about as \"Hitchcockian\" as MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III!',\n",

Emmanuelle Devos as Agnès, Marc\\'s wife continues to astound me with her expressiveness. (See La Femme de Gilles to see her at her emoting best.)

Reilly recalls his tortured childhood,up thru his late adolescence with a mix of snide humour & pained memories (how he even got through childhood & adolescence with a vile,racist,homophobic control fanatic Mother,a alcoholic,manic depressive Father,a comatose Aunt & other dysfunctional family members is a small miracle in itself). He also recalls his early years on Broadway (only after he was rejected by the President of NBC for being gay),and his eventual rise as a television celebrity, makes this for a film to be taken upon. About my only beef is the occasional clumsy camera & editing work that makes this film a wee bit of a challenge (the camera seems to be everywhere it's not supposed to be more than a few times,plus the framing seems to be way off,giving the film a rather clumsy,home movie look, such as 'Ziggy Stardust & The Spiders From Mars',which was marred by bad camera & editing work).

Knowing that CNR was more than just a television perma-guest, I was looking forward to hearing him tell stories as only he can. He didn't disappoint. It takes a gifted storyteller to wring humor and pathos out of a painful childhood, and a sharp observer to make the life story so fresh and consistently surprising. As long as the cameras held steady on CNR and just let the man express himself, the film was excellent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seemed that the film-makers wanted to constantly remind the viewer that this was a FILM documentary. I wanted to hear more stories, especially about his life in the theater, but the film-makers edited three-plus hours of stage material down to barely ninety minutes. This lead to some jarring transitions and title screens explaining what surely must have been great stories. Black-and-white film clips interspersed with CNR's monologue detracted from the stories rather than enhance them. But my biggest complaint, however, was the totally distracting soundtrack. Electric guitars and synthesizers played constantly, often making it difficult to hear CNR's words. The director attended the screening and explained that they were still editing the film, and he seemed to acknowledge that it was difficult to hear at times. I recommend more Charles, mellower editing, and far less soundtrack.<br /><br />The good news is that the director announced the production team's desire to include as a DVD bonus feature an uncut film of CNR's stage show from 2003, which runs about three hours and has plenty of stories and anecdotes. Maybe my problems with the film are really to disguise my disappointment at never being able to see CNR's show live on stage. I hope that uncut film will provide the fix.\",\n",

She and the tracking chip, and the cliff-hanger with Duane attacking her at her home. Yeah, if you didn't care for the Mythology yet you would after this episode. <br /><br />FIVE stars, easily. My second favorite episode yet.\",\n",
       " 'Duane Barry the Limerick:<br /><br />An ex FBI man Duane Barry<br /><br />Gets taken by aliens scary.<br /><br />\"Oh no not again!\"<br /><br />\"I must make this end!\"<br /><br />He takes hostages cuz he is weary.<br /><br />Duane Barry has always been one of my favorite season 2 episodes. I remember when I first bought the season 2 DVD set and watched the episodes in sequence. Before then I had never seen this episode and I hadn\\'t realized just how early in the show Scully\\'s abduction had been.<br /><br />The episode deals with an ex-FBI agent who has become an impulsive liar or something like that, who is a repeat abductee. He finally snaps and decides that in order to keep from being taken again, he needs to get someone else to take his place and thus, kidnaps his doctor and takes a travel agency hostage. This is the first episode of a two-parter and this takes place mostly in the travel agency, and plays out like your typical hostage crisis storyline with the task force talking to the killer and doing everything they can to get a shot on one end and the hostages and shooter on the other end. I\\'m always reminded of the movie with Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey. I think its called The Negotiator. Anyway, Mulder is called in to help talk to Duane because of his \"special\" background and instead Mulder ends up buying into Duane\\'s \"delusion\" which we will later find out was true. Duane is eventually shot and taken to a hospital where an implant is found and removed from his body. Scully takes the implant and scans it at the grocery store causing the register to flip out. Shaken, she goes home and immediately calls Mulder to relate the experience. As she is in the middle of leaving a message, Duane Barry shows up and kidnaps her and we are left with a \"To Be Continued...\" The episode is entertaining and is an important part of the mythology. There aren\\'t exactly a lot of novel or singular moments that make it stand out other than the very unique character of Duane Barry, but nevertheless I do enjoy watching it every time. I will give it a 8 out of 10.',\n",
       " \"This episode is very interesting and it is start of a new era. This is the beginning of the Scully abduction story line, which increased and became a great success. Without the abduction, half the story line wouldn't have happened, all thanks to Duane Barry. Duane Barry is a very interesting character. Anyway, now I will say Good and Bad things about this episode,<br /><br />The Good: Wow, that was very brave of Mulder to go in there. =O<br /><br />Duane Barry talking in 3rd person. xD<br /><br />Finding out her might me lieing in the end. Wow.<br /><br />The Bad: The torture scenes. =[[<br /><br />Conclusion: A good episode all over. 8/10\",\n",
       " \"I consider my watching of the Hanna Barbera cartoons at its peak to be in the late 1970's. Other than the original Where Are You? series of 1969,I felt the next best animated Scooby Doo shows were the ones made between 1976 and 1978. The Scooby Doo Show had lots of great and memorable episodes. The only guest characters who surfaced in this series were Scooby's retarded cousin Scooby Dum. As annoying as he was, I say give me Scooby Dum over the likes of Scrappy Doo any day!! Also, there was Scooby Dee in that one episode. I noticed that when I acquired the Scooby Doo Dynomutt Hour on DVD, they only had the episodes from the 1976 season. Apparently, Hanna Barbera is skipping over the other half of these shows, though I don't understand why. I'm assuming the other half of these shows must have aired in 1977 as part of Scooby's All Star Laff a Lympics. <br /><br />Anyway, I noticed that in the late 70's the group split ups this time had it where Fred and both the girls went off together leaving Shaggy and Scooby together to provide all the laughs as opposed to the Velma hanging with Shaggy and Scooby while Fred and Daphne paired off like the old series.<br /><br />As for the villains, we saw the likes of the Spectre, The Gator Ghoul, The No Face Zombie and Gorilla, the 10,000 Volt Ghost and more. SO apparently, the Scooby Doo Show had three seasons. The third season sticks out in my mind more than any other. These 16 episodes are what some people say is supposed to be a continuation of the Where Are You? series, only with late 70's style animation. There were no guest characters in this series and the villains ranged from the Willowah, Iron Face, The Cat Creature, the Jaguaro,the Lock Ness Monster, the Disco Phantom, and more. These shows were a little spookier than the previous seasons and what really sticks out in my mind about these episodes is the stock music that Hanna Barbera used in these 16 episodes. These 16 episodes aired in 1978 as the opening segment of the new 90 minute Scooby's All Stars series and these episodes are coming out on DVD later this year. But what I was saying music wise, these 16 episodes had stock music that was also heard on Challenge of the SuperFriends, both the Challenge and Non Challenge episodes of 1978.<br /><br />Bottom line, I feel the best Scooby Doo shows were the original Where Are You series and these 1976-1978 episodes and also, the Scooby Movies of the early 70's. But it stops right here. Up next, disaster called Scrappy Doo!! Please WB, release the remaining Scooby episodes of 1977 on DVD as well as the Laff a Lympics. DYNOMUTT: DOG WONDER: This was not only a spin off to me from Scooby Doo, but also a parody of Batman and Robin, only in this case, the sidekick (a mechanical one) is the actual star while the hero is actually the costar. Dynomutt was hilarious as the mechanical Dog Wonder who although being a state of the art (at least at the time) crimefighter, Dog Wonder always malfunctioned. The real reason I liked Dynomutt was because of the Blue Falcon, who to me was nothing more than a Batman ripoff. Oddly enough, without Dynomutt around, BF is quite efficient as a Super Hero. But Dog Wonder's malfunctions always hindered Big Citys hero instead of helping him. And who can forget the likes of his arch enemies like Superthug, the Queen Hornet, The Gimmick, FishFace,the Worm, and Lowbrow. I also enjoyed the few episodes where Scooby Doo and the gang of Mystery Inc. guest appeared.<br /><br />Only a few episodes of Dynomutt are not on the DVD, so I am assuming they ran in 1977 on the Laff a Lympics shows. Either way, you can't miss with these Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour episodes on DVD. If you're a major Hanna Barbera fan, I highly recommend this series.\",\n",
       " \"The Scooby Doo is a very good show, though not as good as my childhood favourite Scooby Doo Where Are You? and this is coming from a biased Scooby Doo fan. The animation is perhaps a little dated by today's standards, but not that bad at all. The theme tune is perfectly fine too. Scooby and Shaggy have still got their fun and charm, and there are one or two appearances from Scooby Dumb. As much as I love Fred, Velma and Daphne, Scooby and Shaggy will always be my favourite characters, these two never fail to make me laugh. There are some very memorable villains like the Ice Cream Ghosts, The Gator Ghoul, Ironface and the Jaguaroo, and again, I can't decide which one's my favourite. All in all, not as good as Scooby Doo Where are You, but is still an improvement over most of the stuff with Scrappy in. 9/10 Bethany Cox.\",\n",
       " \"Opinions and taste is up to an individual: logic is not.<br /><br />Having worked in five countries and been around the block...a few times,I know the value of being able to chill out in order to get positive goals done! Dynomutt allows people to relax and it is a no brainer. Good nostalgia cartoons? You bet we need'em in this,sometimes,too serious world being materialistic (and look where that did go since last year). A good laugh is priceless and well needed nowadays. <br /><br />Anyway,isn't it amazing that this DVD has been redone in 2006 shows,somehow,its popularity: trust me,in business they do not do it because they feel like it. They did it because there is a demand...<br /><br />Even me,being French dig the coolness of this cartoon.\",\n",
       " 'I remember watching this movie. It was like 10 years ago. I was only 13 and I still remember it. Because of all the excitement and nice working. I really think that this is one of the real classics of movies! What gets me even more is that the story doesn\\'t end \"good\". The main character dies and that is a rather suprise ending. All in all a real classic of a movie. In my opinion',\n",
       " 'What a mess of a film. This was Toho\\'s first-of the 1980\\'s-foray into Tokusatsu, after a hiatus in 1977 with The War In Space. It was made a year before Godzilla 1984 as well as a year before 2010 came out-and this film bears some striking plot devices to that one, as well as some of the set and miniature designs. The plus is perhaps some outstanding effects work by Koichi Kawakita, for the time; some mesmerizing cloud chamber work, and nice miniature ships,planet scapes and matte and optical work. I\\'d say it well matches anything by Gerry Anderson(think Space:1999) from the late 60\\'s or early 70\\'s. The story is another matter-a black hole is on collision course with earth-however it can be altered if Jupiter is blown up to become a sun. The \"Jupiter Solarization Project\" is being undertaken to create a new sun and thus, colonize the moons of Jupiter. However some space hippies of the \"Jupiter Church\" don\\'t want this to happen. They hang around-when not casually attempting to sabotage the project in orbit around Jupiter-on a beach on earth with this head guru guy who pulls out a guitar and stops the film, and does a musical number! I kid you not. This happens about four times. Accompanied by a montage of images of animals, beaches, dolphins,etc. There is also perhaps one of the biggest rip-off scenes from Jaws ever done, so blatantly. Characters zip back and forth from earth to Jupiter with the edit of a scene. There is also a \"space sex\" scene which they use \"Love Gas\" to achieve. It\\'s corny, cheesy but inexplicably...you can see nary a string or harness on their buck naked bodies! How\\'d they do that? It goes on forever but you can\\'t take your eyes off it, not knowing how \"hot\" this will get. The hippies turn out to be terrorists and somehow we are supposed to empathize with their desire to kill everyone for no reason whatsoever. There are some grand set pieces, devices, and a \"large\" epic look to things. But it never really comes together. They steal everything you can think of from the aforementioned Jaws,Star Wars, The Black Hole and, another blatant effects rip off shot from 2001:A Space Odyssey. The songs are amazing-they don\\'t miss a beat to get one into all four acts of the film and, the end titles, complete with strange lyrics like \"We burn out like a comet\\'s nest\" and \"I will transfer all your pain to me\". The English speaking actors are atrocious for the most part, just completely ruining whatever grand set they are placed in. There is also a scene where a guy is speaking German to a Gaijin guy who speaks Japanese back at him. Huh? There\\'s a Godzilla in-joke that\\'s quite funny, and works, as clips from Ghidorah(1965) manage to make it into the film as one guy seems to be a Kaiju fan. The film was never released here in the states legally, until now. It\\'s been a rarity for American Tokusatsu fans to try and find. And, to me, a letdown.',\n",
       " 'I first thought the film was okay, but I enjoyed it only because of my curiosity stemming from the film\\'s rarity. Not too many people in the Godzilla fan community have seen it, and it should stay that way. When I rewatched it, I started getting bored within the first minute. Many scenes drag on needlessly (e.g. the sex scene against a space backdrop), stretching the film\\'s running time to an unbearable 2 hours, and no \"good bad\" movie can be 2 hours long. Many scenes are inane (e.g. the sex scene..., the hippies). The characters trying to sabotage the Jupiter Solarization Project are horribly annoying because their merely brats who want to be responsible for the deaths of 200 billion people. They have no motivation for this. They\\'re just stupid, annoying, selfish, sanctimonious punks (and of course their leader is French-looking). Despite the running time, you barely know most of the characters, and then they try to milk some tears from you by some pointless death scenes. It breaks the \"don\\'t show a good movie in the middle of your crappy movie\" rule by intercutting a fistfight with scenes from GHIDRAH THE THREE HEADED MONSTER in what I assume is a vapid, nongermane, and utterly pointless social commentary. The music is something out of a high school graduation, repetitive and grating. There\\'s gratuitous cruelty to animals mixed with a laughably bad rubber shark and dolphin. The only good part of this movie are the excellent special effects (excluding the shark and dophin), but they are too few and far between.<br /><br />This entire movie just ticks me off, especially since it took money and good special effects people away from GOJIRA (1984). It just tries to grasp at your heartstrings, but it\\'s filled with stupid, dull, annoying characters you\\'d just love to beat the crap out of and filler on the level of the refueling scenes from THE STARFIGHTERS. Absolutely one of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen.<br /><br />1/10 (It\\'d be 0 if IMDB\\'s ratings went that low)',\n",
       " 'I watched it once about 8 years ago or more, i am a sci-fi fan thats why i rented it. To this day i havent seen a worst movie. Ridiculous plot, lousy acting, crappy Ed Wood-style special (d)effects. Steer clear away from this.<br /><br />',\n",
       " 'This is one of the worst Japanese big budget films I\\'ve run across. The plot has something to do with a project concerning Jupiter going horribly wrong and... you really don\\'t want to know. Trust me as bad as you think some of the Godzilla movies and films like The Green Slime are, this is worse, but not in a good way.<br /><br />This is just stupid, the hippies being the last straw on a short list of reasons to watch, none of which are good. I have no idea why anyone would like this on anything but a technical level since the plot, which I\\'ve finally been able to erase from my mind only thanks to years of very expensive therapy. All I remember is that the film seemed to want to be a flower power film but was made by people who didn\\'t know what that was and were 15 years too late.(these people couldn\\'t plot a film even if they were handed it)<br /><br />This film was suggested to me by a friend who loves it, \"saying you\\'ll either love it or you won\\'t, but I think you will\". He was wrong.<br /><br />Trust me, there are better ways to spend two and a half hours, many much more pleasant',\n",

A fast-paced narration with some interesting incidents weaved in, which doesn't allow you much time to ponder on the flaws, and which camouflages the inadequacies of the script, makes 'Varalaru' engaging viewing. And the soul of the film is undoubtedly Ajit, who performs his three diverse characters with panache. The actor has put in much effort, demarcating each role with such finesse and understanding that it is a sheer delight watching him on screen. There is Shiva, the ageing business tycoon, bound to his wheelchair, sharing a strong bonding with his son Vishnu. Indulgent, while Vishnu whiles away his time with his cronies taking life easy. But then suddenly Vishnu starts behaving out of character, his drunken bouts and acts causing the father much shame and embarrassment. And when Vishnu professes to remember nothing of what he had done, the father takes him to a psychiatrist.With 'Varalaru' Ajit has bounced back with a vengeance and re-established his credentials as an actor who can deliver if given the right role and projected suitably. The famished look of 'Tirupati' is gone, and we get to see a handsome, eminently watchable Ajit here.Then appears Jeeva, Vishnu's look-alike, and the cause of Vishnu's woes. Jeeva's target is Shiva, and his motive vengeance for the wrong done to his mother decades back. The flashback episodes has Ajit playing a classical dancer, and it is here that the actor scores. With his perfect body language to go with the character of the dancer, and the feminine mannerisms he adopts to go with it, Ajit cuts a fascinating picture. His classical dance number is performed with such finesse that it takes you by sheer surprise.<br /><br />While Asin peps up the scenes in the earlier part with her vivaciousness, Kaniha gets the performing role as the older Ajit's pair.<br /><br />The songs are nice to hear, going to hit the chart list soon. One of the great work of A.R.Rehman, Director K S Ravikumar, who had struck the right chord with the actor (in a dual role) in 'Villain' earlier, has done it yet again here too.<br /><br />Everyone did their job perfectly.

This is really intriguing in the flow of the narration. <br /><br />K.S.Ravikumar is in his usual stuff taking the plot of prostitution for the romance of the lead pair. <br /><br />A.R.Rahman's songs are hummable and good to watch.Overall Ajith's performance raises this movie and it lived to its expectation and the long wait was worth.\",\n",
       " \"Varalaru is an good movie - It has the dubious distinction of failing at every imaginable level.<br /><br />Featuring Ajith in a triple role, Varalaru represents a combination of all the worst elements in Tamil movies.<br /><br />A pitiful story, horrible acting by Ajith, mediocre music, crude action scenes and juvenile comic interludes combine to deliver a stinging migraine to unsuspecting viewers.<br /><br />Varalaru is so bad that it can easily be showcased at film schools as an illustration of an egregiously bad movie.<br /><br />Ajith plays the role of a father Shivashankar and his two sons Vishnu and Jeeva. He overacts in all three roles but is particularly bad as the father. Ajith is only slightly better in the character of Jeeva, the vengeful young lad intent on killing his father whom he blames for his mother's madness.<br /><br />Apart from Ajith's acting (or is it non-acting), the other big weakness of Varalaru is its asinine story, which gives new meaning to the term bizarre.<br /><br />The totally unconvincing story dooms the movie from the get-go. It's weird to even conceive of a mother who harbors affection for her daughter's rapist.<br /><br />Then there are Varalaru's dialogs, which never rise above the banal.<br /><br />Asin plays the lady love of Vishnu but does not have much of a role. Which is a pity since the young girl is showing signs of becoming a good actress. Since the story revolves around Ajith's three roles, there is little scope for Asin to demonstrate her talents here.<br /><br />Music genius Rehman has failed to deliver the goods in Varalaru. None of the songs rise above the ordinary. Katril Oru Vaarthai is perhaps the best of the lot.<br /><br />Vishnu, the son of a rich businessman Shiva, generally likes to have a good time in the company of his friends. While visiting a village called Thottapuram on a social service mission, he meets a young girl Divya (Asin) and is smitten with her.<br /><br />Soon, the youngsters are engaged to each other and set to marry shortly.<br /><br />But things start to go terribly wrong for Vishnu soon. He commits various violent acts that he has no recollection of later. When Vishnu's violent behavior gets worse, his father has him admitted to a mental hospital.<br /><br />We quickly realize that the evil hand behind Vishnu's violent activities is actually his look-alike Jeeva.<br /><br />But why is Jeeva doing all those criminal acts and shifting the blame on Vishnu? The answer lies in Shivashankar's distant past as an<br /><br />dancer who is jilted literally at the altar. Unable to bear the shock, his mother dies sending Shiva into a violent rage that leads him to rape the girl (Kanika) who jilted him.<br /><br />Although Kanika has a short role, the young lass shows that she can indeed act, a rarity in Tamil movies.<br /><br />All in all, Varalaru is awful to endure, rotten to contemplate and unpleasant to narrate\",\n",

The movie is incredibly bad, too bad that even A.R.Rahman couldn\\'t save it with really lackluster music and songs, he cant be blamed though there was nothing to get inspired to make even decent music.

While I was aware of the sacrilege going on in the Amazon, this opened my eyes to it like never before. Shortly after this I ran away from home with a friend, with the intention of going to Brazil, mobilising the Indians into a guerrilla band and killing the loggers. It took our families all of two days to track us down at a port city : )<br /><br />But I never forgot the lesson this movie taught me and today I work for a conservation organisation. Some of the Indian quotes from the movie are truly tear jerkers. \"When we were young the end of the world(the limits of the forest) was very far away, but it gets closer and closer each day\" or something to that effect. As an idealistic kid I saw no flaw in this movie and cheered at the improbable climax where the rains destroy the dam and the captured Indian women throw away their cheap clothes and return to the forest.

The costumes are fairly authentic, and portrayal of many tribal customs is well done. The manhood ceremony is closely based on authentic ceremonies that happen in most tribes. <br /><br />Altogether, about as good as you can expect from something that is not intended to be a documentary.',\n",

This is one movie you will never forget.<br /><br />I have heard it said that the true test of a movie, or any art form, is whether it accomplishes what it set out to do. Did it inform you, delight you, anger you, scare you, or make you laugh? Besides presenting a very entertaining and original storyline, this movie wants you to care about the environment. After seeing The Emerald Forest, I immediately called one of the major environmental organizations (I don\\'t want to play favorites, but it\\'s one of these: The Nature Conservancy, WWF, Greenpeace, The Sierra Club...) to set up automatic monthly contributions. I never expected a movie to have so great an impact on me, especially such a long lasting one. You would expect that, after time, my enthusiasm would diminish, especially since I have no interest in ever visiting the Amazon! None whatsoever. However, this movie really changed my perspective on the global environment as a whole.<br /><br />The central character is Tomme (Charlie Boorman). While watching his father direct the construction of a huge dam, Tomme is quickly and silently taken away by a native Brazilian Indian tribe called the Invisibles. They don\\'t see their actions as kidnapping. When they see the young boy, they figure he would be better off with them, rather than with the \"termite people\", the name they give to the white men who seem to devour all the trees.<br /><br />Tomme\\'s father spends the next 10 years trying to find him.<br /><br />This is definitely a thought-provoking movie, but one that is not too heavy handed. It\\'s one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen, the type of movie you can watch over and over.<br /><br />Update: Since I had not seen this movie for many years, I decided to see it again last night. I was totally blown away. It was even better than I remembered. Although my original 9-star rating is very high praise, I can\\'t fathom how I could have enjoyed the movie more, so I raised my rating from 9 stars to 10 stars. Director John Boorman also directed Beyond Rangoon, and some other films that are amazingly good.<br /><br />Charley Boorman\\'s performance is simply brilliant.

Very profound and touching, very good acting, excellent photography, technically superb, there's nothing to really complain about. It hasn't aged at all and probably won't. I gave it a 10 because I do not see anything to improve. In our sad new era of ethnological destruction, where there's no place anymore for the Aborigene or any other tribal culture, this movie gives a little hope, a little reverie of seeing things turning in the right direction thanks to ancient magic. How vain but how beautiful!\",\n",
       " \"Touching, well-paced, sad, uplifting, absorbing. Good acting, good writing. Lots of meaning, lots of symbolism, but never in your face, never tiring. Mystical stuff that's presented well and believably. A movie at once so ambitious and so real and so well-done...there just aren't very many in its league. Action, love, adventure, drama, striking images, succinct dialog. Amazing.\",\n",
       " 'Not sure that you\\'ll get a comment from anyone of my generation (the Depression-ridden 30\\'s) about the Emerald Forest. But here goes, anyway...<br /><br />I first became aware of the term \"ecology\" when I signed up for a masters-level college class of the same name in 1965. It was the first formalization of the study of ecology on the West Coast. I took it simply because I needed a natural science credit and all the other classes were full. The class changed my life, and my perspectives. I devoured Rachel Carson, and savored movies like Dances With Wolves and Medicine Man. I even joined Green Peace at the age of 32 and suspect that I am probably the only Republican in history that can make that claim.<br /><br />I would vote that Emerald Forest is the best of all popular eco-message dramas. It is my all time favorite. It is so well done in every area...script, acting, photography, and re-enactment of tribal customs. At the same time, it delivers a powerful message that can only be dismissed by the most callous of personalities. Every time I see the movie I am filled with regret that I could never accomplish such a landmark cinematographic ecological statement.<br /><br />I was also filled with the emotion to go to Brazil and blow away anyone with a chainsaw...',\n",
       " \"This film is nice as a step out of the usual backgrounds or settings for movies. And whilst it is in the main part shot in rain forest, it is most certainly not boring in any way.<br /><br />I notice there have been comments by others about certain mystical aspects in the film being too far fetched, but i can assure they are not. Following this, it is quite understandable that if someone watches this and has a limited understanding of reality and the mind - they may find certain aspects of the film slightly frustrating and/or overly convenient to be true. An example here is the art of merging with spirits who take on certain archetypal forms, such as an eagle or leopard. These are very ancient shamanic methods used to attain knowledge, power and healing abilities and are not a crazy load of made up stuff by the director. I have personally had many similar experiences to some in the film - example: once some way through a year long shamanic training, i lay on my bed and merged with a spirit and found myself as the form of an eagle (as was usual with this spirit). I had asked the spirit to take me to a gorgeous girl i had met in London a few weeks before, as i regretted never asking for her phone number after having to rush for a train. I found myself flying above London and eventually landed in leicester square where the spirit told me i should go. I finished the journey, left my house, got on the train and went to leicester square. The first person i talked to (a guy doing the charity stuff on the street) turned out to be one of the flat-mates of the girl! Einstein said 'co-incidences are God's way of remaining anonymous'. The point of this story is that the mystical stuff in Emerald Forest is factual. And it is not confined to rainforests, but in fact can be and is used in modern cities - ha ha and not just to save tribes but sometimes God willing to get girlfriends! Then also the idea that sickness (in the films case, a severe fever from enemy tribal poison), can be sucked out of someone in it's elemental energetic form- this is also ancient practise which traditionally one is merging with a helpful spirit to gain powerful protection beforehand - as is demonstrated in the film. All the mystical stuff is indeed actually down to earth, factual and to be embraced.<br /><br />And this is one particular thing which brings beautiful harmony to The Enchanted Forest - it is not just down to earth because of it's setting, because of good actors and acting or because of a good story - but because it has not been afraid to remain true to another part of life, inherent in the films settings and culture. That which perhaps seems overly mystical to the average western mind. For me it seemed nothing had been left out of the film, as often is the case in order to meet the wishes of studios, who only care about their profit and not the wealth of the film itself as a branch of art.<br /><br />Bear in mind that the whole film is based on a true story and really how can you go wrong? Adventurous, beautiful scenery, good acting, good characters, based on true story, unusual spiritual elements, emotional and action plus a good eco message leaving you wishing the whole world would watch it.<br /><br />Enjoy!\",\n",

The story grabs you almost from the very start as a young boy, son of Americans, is whisked away from his parents by Amazon rain forest natives. <br /><br />Ten years later, the kid - now being a teenager - is discovered by his father who had never stopped searching for him. During that search, and afterward, we are witness to numerous action scenes, really nice jungle photography and just a fascinating story.<br /><br />The cinematography, involving story, no profanity and just plain good adventure all make this movie an entertaining one.

       " 'The movie the Emerald Forest was a fictional story that was based on a true story. Boorman based his movie of a article that appeared in the Los Angeles Time in the early 1980\\'s which talked about a father whose son was abducted by native tribes and rediscovered ten years later. This may be a true story although there are critics out there who claim that the man made up the story because he wanted attention. The Emerald Forest was a very good film. The Emerald Forest was the first film to bring up the issue of the destruction of the Amazon. The locations are picturesque and Boorman is able to capture the cultural authenticity of the native tribes of the Amazon. What really surprised me was that Boorman did not use actors but went deep into the jungles of Brazil to find real natives to give his a film an authentic feel. This was especially true regarding the Invisible People who Boorman portrayed as a mysterious and elusive tribe which is demonstrated when they are camouflaged in the jungle and manage to stroke Tommy\\'s face with a feather undetected by his family who are only a few feet a away from the Invisible People. That being said although Boorman did capture the authenticity of the native tribes and address the issue of deforestation the storyline was a little dull and cliché. This movie contains all the clichés that other movies have where a white man meets the natives. The first major cliché we can see in the movie is when the white men come they bring with them guns and alcohol and of course they exploit the natives. Another cliché is that as the white men come and development and progress disturbs the native\\'s way of living as well as destroy the rainforest. The final cliché which we see in a lot of movies where natives play a predominant role is that the native lifestyle is portrayed as a sanctuary that sin has never entered. I still believe the film was good and I understand for the most part that is really what happens but Boorman could have made the film a bit more interesting and different and still portray his message. The preservation of the rainforest can easily be identified as the overriding and most obvious theme portrayed in this movie. The concern for maintaining the rainforest is demonstrated through the presumed wisdom we are called to see in the American Indian elders, however; Bill Markham is blind to this wisdom until the end of the movie. A few statistics are also thrown around in the movie concerning the role the Amazon plays in the world and how the white man is destroying it all by bringing industry to the area. The statistics are thrown around in a subtle way for Markham to realize the implications and damage he has caused by building the damn, showing them as being far greater and vaster than he had expected. It was powerful to hear the reporter say that 40 percent of the world\\'s oxygen supply is generated by the rain forests and watch Markham dismiss him because of his ignorance to the real issue. Also, the movie goes on to assert that 5,000 acres of Amazonian rainforest is disappearing every day. This is actually generous. Once Markham realizes the vastness of the problem, the tables had already been turned on him. He too is kidnapped and is rescued by his son \"Tomme\". This scene was powerful because it shows that the boy had actually become loyal to his kidnappers and what they stand for, not the white man plight for development and industrialization. Through all of Bill\\'s begging and pleading, he wouldn\\'t return back to civilization with his biological father. What does it reveal to his Bill? He finally understands the destruction of life he had contributed to over the past 10 years and tries to undo his wrong by letting a violent thunderstorm destroy the dam they built.',\n",
       " \"One of the most faithful nuns in her convent, Sister Maria finds herself obsessed by the Devil. Obsessed, not possessed, because Satan is an external force in this film. A strapping and vampiric lad, the Devil brings out Sister Maria's inner desires for both sex and blood. Plagued also by her devotion to God, she tries to fight these forbidden desires and lusts with prayer and penitence only to have them come back ten fold. Sister Maria is suddenly caught between Satanic submission or death.<br /><br />Satanico Pandemonium is a good nunsploitation effort in the vein of, the more celebrated, Juan Lopez Moctezuma'a Alucarda. It has sex, nudity, lesbianism, child seduction, self mutilation, blood, and death(not necessarily in that order, of course). The ending is clever and surprising following a bloody and ravenous climax. If you're a fan of nunsploitation and offbeat cinema, do yourself a favor and check out Satanico Pandemonium. You won't regret it.\",\n",
       " 'Even though I have ambiguous estimations about this film on the whole, I can only say for sure that \"Satanico Pandemonium\" is a must-see nunsploitation Mexican flick for anyone who can be pleased about these kinds of movies for their evident ridiculousness. This is one of those flicks that have too many flaws and no plot whatsoever but it\\'s still impossible not to like them, for some imprecise cause. The acting is not exactly Academy Award material and it causes unintended laughter. The special effects in which we see the concept of Satan and temptation itself represented on a laughable guy naked, is by far one of the most hysterical things about this film, along with the outrageously shabby sound effects during these strange apparitions. The whole thing just looks too tacky and the look on the guy\\'s face is simply priceless, so how can anyone not love it?. I know some people could take it as a reason to overthrow the director\\'s gracious effort, but I myself, found it too silly not to like it. Without offering an actual share of real horror, \"Satanico Pandemonium\" manages to get the attention, even if it is by some means erroneously advertised. There are some noble allocations of gore here and there, but the film mostly focuses on the drama and eroticism. The first half an hour happens to be ineffective in a way and that would be the only reasons why I felt compelled to turn it off throughout the first minutes and leave it incomplete. It contains no dialogs, no action and for the most part only a nice display of beautiful Mexican landscapes, which is not exactly enough to make it endurable. However, it is only a matter of persistence to realize that after the big unnecessary moments of silence and boredom, the story starts to develop some of the most astonishing states of affairs, in which we see lesbian soft-core sex between two nuns, a nun taking advantage of a teenage boy and some enjoyable bloody murders inside the convent. Without anything else to add, I can only recommend \"Satánico Pandemonium\" to anyone who is in the mood for a decent nunsploitation drama, with some utterly random sexual scenes, a couple of nice murders to attach at least a small share of horror to the story, a badly placed background story of racism and of course...lots of sexy and sinful nuns.',\n",
       " 'I haven\\'t watched that many \"Nunsploitation\" films, but the ones I did were among the more prominent titles from the subgenre - Ken Russell\\'s THE DEVILS (1971), Jess Franco\\'s THE DEMONS (1972) and LOVE LETTERS OF A Portuguese NUN (1977), and Juan Lopez Moctezuma\\'s ALUCARDA (1975) - and this one, though less well-known (which may be due to the fact that its prolific director had cut his teeth on lowbrow commercial stuff, including several \"Santo\" movies!), is just as good.<br /><br />Hilariously, the production company which made it is called Hollywood Films and finance was provided by the \"Promocion Turistica Mexicana\" (what were they thinking?)! Despite the obvious low-budget, the quality of the cinematography (including its color scheme and the moody lighting) is very adequate - if not exactly smooth! The score, too, is notable in its schizophrenia: lively pop and electronic sounds (as in the rather silly orgy at the end, in which some of the bawdy nuns were actually played by prostitutes hired expressly for this one scene!) alternating with pastoral/lyrical sections and the occasional reverent passage inside the convent.<br /><br />The film, unfortunately, badly lacks pace and several shots run longer than is necessary - apart from it being somewhat repetitive (particularly during the possessed nun\\'s sex-and-death rampage and her subsequent attempts to cover her tracks, which scenes may have influenced the first half of THE ANTICHRIST [1974]; SATANICO PANDEMONIUM itself was partly inspired by Matthew Lewis\\' celebrated novel THE MONK - which Luis Bunuel, friend of the director and my personal favorite film-maker, adapted for the screen {but didn\\'t direct} around this same time...and which I managed to catch while in Hollywood early last January!) It is, however, galvanized by an exceptional leading performance from the statuesque (and Keira Knightley look-alike!) Cecilia Pezet.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the film faced censorship problems with its seduction (and later sex) scenes involving a nun and an under-aged shepherd boy!; his subsequent murder at her hands, however, is extremely unconvincing. Like ALUCARDA, the film doesn\\'t dwell on period reconstruction (and, in fact, we only realize when the story actually takes place via a reference towards the end to the Inquisition); still, a few social/racial issues are raised nonetheless with the presence of the two black nuns/maids, who are mistreated even by their white \\'colleagues\\'!<br /><br />One of its most interesting - and audacious - concepts is the way the film subverts its own intentions by pasting four endings to the narrative back-to-back: a) the girl renounces her sins and is about to allow herself to be captured by her fellow nuns; b) the Devil (campily coiffured and given to elementary conjuring tricks, but aptly incarnated by the handsome Enrique Rocha - who, at one point, even manifests himself to Pezet in the guise of a lesbian nun!) re-appearing to offer her the post of Mother Superior at the convent (the girl having conveniently murdered the current one), whereupon she discovers that her colleagues have been possessed as well, though they still end up killing her!; c) the whole story is revealed to have been merely the delusional fantasy of the main character, under shadow of death from the plague!!; and d) the devil is, however, seen to be all too real and has already set his sights on a new \\'victim\\' at the convent.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s a bit of unintended notoriety connected with the title of this film. You have to see the 1996 Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez writer-director collaboration From Dusk Til Dawn, an un-P.C. film if ever there was one, to get it. The movie\\'s characters have set up shop at a trucker\\'s and biker\\'s bar, the Titty Twister, to cool their heels. The M.C. announces a new entertainer for the stage, a woman named Santanico Pandemonium. The voluptuous actress Salma Hayek steps out draped with a huge snake and little else, and proceeds to rock her hips to the delight of every man who can see her. It\\'s a stunning moment toward the middle of a not very striking flick.<br /><br />Satanico Pandemonium isn\\'t only exploitation, it belongs to a genre called \"nunsploitation.\" The place is Spain and the time is most likely pre-1834. Sister Maria (Cecilia Pezet) is a devoted nun who finds herself visited by visions of Satan, or Luzbel. The devil appears as a man to Sister Maria, and using obvious Biblical symbolism, tends to carry a bitten-into apple. Sister Maria is startled and horrified by the series of temptations that happen to her via the film\\'s faulty special effects. As another user has pointed out, this is an obsession scenario by an external devil.<br /><br />One important observation should be stated. The actress playing Sister Maria is very beautiful with warm, bedroom eyes, and many of us (meaning men) wouldn\\'t mind watching her getting robbed of her virtue - as well as tormented by particular sins. But what happens is with a little influence from Beelzebub, Sister Maria soon indulges in lesbianism, child seduction and heresy. The film has a church-like quality to the way it moves slowly and harps upon moments of less-than-dramatic value, and with its fantastic logic, Sister Maria turns into hell in a headdress. One scene in particular is actually quite disturbing, with Sister Maria covering her naked, bloody body with her uniform.<br /><br />The flick isn\\'t entirely baldfaced exploitation though, with interesting questions about faith in the dialogue. That aside, the flick\\'s appeal seems rather obvious. In life, most of us want what we cannot have, and the fantasy of despoiling such a person (i.e., a nun) can be very powerful. Satanico Pandemonium uses its subject matter effectively, and despite an unsatisfying story resolution, it packs quite a wallop.',\n",
       " \"This movie is true to form with the opening of racial prejudice towards the nuns who're not Mexican.<br /><br />I have read many reviews in where this movie was very confusing but this is not the case because this generation of movie viewer has to have everything explained to them because it hurts to think. Blame capitalism, blame the information age, Hell, blame me but if you have read such reviews don't take it to heart for ye will surely be deceived!!! The movie is about a nun who's harassed by the devil all because of her purity or desire to be chaste. Eversince she's been in contact with El Levid whom I shall refer to as (The Count of Dantecrispo, sister purity gets the urge to seduce goat herders and fellow nuns.<br /><br />I will not share any more but for me, it's worth the investment.

       " 'This was one tame yawn of a \"nunsploitation\".<br /><br />There were like a coupla boob shots, one feeble, forced-looking lesbian kissing scene, and apparently one \"rape\" scene.

ACTING: Okay, very subtle CHARACTERS: No real development, sympathy towards any of the characters, devil is lame. STORYLINE: Just plain ol\\' flatline. Nothing really happens. <br /><br />The nun apparently being \"possessed by the devil\" is just uninspiring and cheesy. Don\\'t buy the plot line that she\\'s a \"bride of Satan\". It\\'s a crock.<br /><br />Uneventful, waste of film. The appeal of the title is definitely better than the actual film!',\n",
       " 'I came across this film under the title \"Hot Sweat\" at my local video store, and rented it out of curiosity; I had seen many movies by this director, and always thought his work was severely underated. The movie really surprised me with it\\'s unsensationalistic style and well done cinematography. Although the female lead is very beautiful, and manages to get undressed frequently, there is always a tension to her sexuality...she is forced to rely on it only because the audience is clearly made aware that on the other side is the penniless abyss. Rutger Haur plays totally against type as a foppish young bank officer who adopts her as his mistress.<br /><br />I think most people today think of Holland as a totally liberal and affluent country. This film goes a long way towards dispelling that stereotype, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a (sometimes brutally) realistic picture of 19th century life among the underclass in Amsterdamn. I liked it.',\n",
       " '\"Keetje Tippel\" is one of Verhoeven\\'s lesser known movies but it really deserves to be seen and better known, all over the world. Reason why it isn\\'t known better is I think because of \"Turks fruit\" from 1973. After that movie people expected this movie to be a sort of \"Turks fruit 2\", also because it was once again directed by Verhoeven and had Monique van de Ven and Rutger Hauer as the two main leads. \"Turks fruit\" and \"Keetje Tippel\" (and in a way also Verhoeven\\'s earlier movie \"Wat zien ik\") show some similarities in the way the story is told but it are in fact of course two totally different movies.<br /><br />The movie provides a pretty good and insightful view of life in late 19th century Amsterdam. The atmosphere of the old Amsterdam is perfectly captured by Jan de Bont\\'s cinematography and by the costume design and art direction.<br /><br />What makes \"Keetje Tippel\" better than the average period drama is the directness of the story telling. This is of course thanks to Verhoeven\\'s typical style of directing that always is very direct and straight to the point. Once more the movie features quite some nudity and confronting scene\\'s. But it all works well because it serves a purpose in the movie and it\\'s obviously not only put in it to simply shock the viewer in a cheap way. The movie however is quite short and it didn\\'t feel that the movie covered the entire story and the ending is abrupt and not entirely satisfying because it still leaves a bunch of questions unanswered.<br /><br />The acting isn\\'t always top-class but this is more because of the simple dialog, rather than its the actors their fault. Rutger Hauer however deserves credit for his role and he plays his character in a very believable way. Monique van de Ven is good for about 70% of the time but her acting really pushes it at times and her character at times goes a bit too much over-the-top. The movie further more features a good supporting cast.<br /><br />The story is always interesting and you never know what is going to happen next, thanks to the unpredictable and realistic characters that are being portrayed in this movie. The movie is based on the real life of Neel Doff, which gives the movie an even more realistic and confronting feeling.<br /><br />Better than your average period drama\\'s. See this movie if you get the chance.<br /><br />8/10',\n",
       " 'I was recently given the Anchor Bay DVD release of this title as a present, and I have to say that while I am impressed with the usual European frankness about things that would never make it into American films, this is probably among the least of Paul Verhoeven\\'s work. Not that this is bad from the get-go. I would far prefer to watch a bad film from Paul Verhoeven than what could be considered good among the stables of directors like Peter Jackson or Jerry Bruckheimer. They say that the key to artistic success is being honest with yourself, and Verhoeven is a big example of the principle. More on that in a moment.<br /><br />The story of Keetje Tippel concerns itself with a young woman named Keetje, who migrates from one end of Holland to another during the nineteenth century. The name might be obvious from the title, but one thing that should have been made clearer is that Tippel is not her family name. Tippel actually refers to the profession she winds up taking in order to fuel her rise from the gutter.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film, Keetje is an idealist with little, if any, idea of how the capitalist society she enters actually works. She starts out going from one crappy job to the next. The first of which makes it clear that worker health and safety was a very minor concern at best in this primitive era. We see Keetje and numerous other workers dipping textiles into lye, no gloves or any other kind of protection, and we see its effects at various stages in the film. From there, Keetje falls into working as a seamstress, and eventually, as a prostitute.<br /><br />One touch of Dutch cinema that I\\'ve always liked since I have become acquainted with it through Verhoeven\\'s work is that there isn\\'t always a happy ending. In Keetje Tippel, our titular hero does nothing to help the poor that she was once a member of. In fact, one of the many things she winds up doing in the latter part of the film hurts them very badly. This can be understood when one looks at some attitudes to what people feel when they get out of a situation they cannot stand. For example, were I to leave Australia and live somewhere like England, the only way in which I would lift a finger to help others who are unhappy with the lot Australia has is by helping them leave. Like rats from a sinking ship, as it were. That\\'s the attitude of the character, and it is even more understandable in the context of nineteenth century social conditions.<br /><br />The thing that keeps Keetje Tippel from obtaining the unqualified ten out of ten rating I normally give Verhoeven\\'s Dutch-language films is, ironically, the same thing that normally prompts this rating. For once, the brutal honesty and unflinching depiction of reality counts against the film. Rather than the stomach churning for a second before expressing amazement, I found myself asking if the depiction of bodily functions is really necessary. Those who have seen the uncut versions of Soldaat Van Oranje, Turks Fruit, or even De Vierde Man, will understand what I am talking about here.<br /><br />During the audio commentary Anchor Bay had recorded for the DVD release, the difference between Verhoeven and many a Hollywood director becomes obvious in a big hurry. Where other directors will attempt to put a spin on every aspect of their films, or even try to congratulate themselves, Verhoeven is so frank and honest that his commentaries could be used in film-making schools. Unlike Peter Jackson and his vapid writing staff, you won\\'t hear Verhoeven trying to justify his artistic decisions from a position of arrogance. It\\'s not \"how do you expect me to do this? do you think you can do better?\", but rather \"I did this this way because... and I am pleased/disappointed with the results, so I will do it again/try something else next time\". If all directors in Hollywood were this brutally honest, American film would be much more palatable nowadays.<br /><br />I gave Keetje Tippel an eight out of ten. Its realism earns it a ten out of ten for the most part, but there are times when it either goes too far, or lets its ambition exceed its ability enough, to deduct two points. Jan Wolkers, the author of the novel on which Turks Fruit is based, had similar feelings about Turks Fruit, so this is quite easily viewed as a case of a new director faltering a little as he learns his craft. Still, with early pieces like Keetje Tippel and Turks Fruit, it is not a surprise that Verhoeven would go on to such masterpieces as Total Recall or RoboCop. The DVD is well worth the Amazon asking price.',\n",
       " 'If you like Paul Verhoeven\\'s later work (Robocop, Total Recall, Black Book), you should take the time to delve into his Dutch language work.<br /><br />This is a serious work showing class differences in 19th Century Holland, and the total lack of concern for workers. The title character takes a slew of meaningless jobs after the family is forced to move to the city, eventually ending up as a prostitute to survive.<br /><br />Hearing the typical \"streets paved with gold\" dreams that were typical of America at that time, we can totally relate to those driven from their farms.<br /><br />Women were certainly toys for men, even doctors, to play with, and rape, if they chose.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Rutgar Hauer in a role as a gentlemen, and the experience of Monique van de Ven was not to be missed.',\n",
       " \"I recorded this movie a few weeks ago from our local community television station Triangle's night broadcast. I was surprised to see this on their schedule, as it's usually the lowest rate affair. The situation was another example of a great work getting lost in another vast video copy collection.<br /><br />I was excited to be seeing an early movie from a director I always admired. I'd only ever seen his Hollywood work, and was especially fond of his Sci-Fi classics growing up. As others recognize, Verhoeven unashamedly puts into his films, his honest impression of the societal constructs we humans consistently find ourselves in. That regular criticism of the complexities of human nature, beyond the norms of each film's particular genre, has always resonated with my world view.<br /><br />I finally watched this film this morning. As it started it was obvious the image quality was very poor, not helped by early scenes being predominantly in the dark. Not surprisingly the character's voices were dubbed into English, but were often mismatched or exaggerated, unfitting for the film. It seems to be the UK version I saw, yet some accents were American. I always try to watch a film in it's original intended language, but it seems the foreign films on the local community station are only ever poorly dubbed video copies.<br /><br />Despite the poor quality of the copy I saw (the video company's logo even popped up irregularly in the bottom corner of the image), this film really amazed me. Much of the reasons why have been detailed by the few other comments on this site. The biggest flaw of the story for me was that the film ended too suddenly. This seems a common element to films the further back in cinema history you go. I actually appreciate a well crafted credits sequence, easing the viewer out of the film's world, and allowing reflection. Even at nearly 2 hours long, I felt my interest would have been sustained for a little bit longer.<br /><br />There is a DVD listed here with 5 of Verhoeven's films in their original Dutch form, with English subtitles. I'd like to see this one again, and the rest of his early creations, which others consider even better. Rutger Hauer is also a great, varied yet charismatic actor, and it seems his best work might be with Verhoeven.\",\n",

He takes a very serious subject, extreme poverty and how it leads to social uprising, and adds his personal light touches that almost make you forget the political subtext. The \"finger shadow\" scene before the rape was a touch of cinematic genius that I almost missed the first time around.<br /><br />The ultimate lesson seems to me to be, of course, that we are all whores, it just depends on how much we can afford to spend on clothes.<br /><br />One question, if she was so poor, how did she keep her roots died blonde?',\n",

Dawson, Irene Cattell, Maidel Turner and Margaret Hamilton) were in the original Broadway production which opened 25 April 1932, and who reprised their roles. This was also the film debut of Beal, Hamilton and Cattell (the only film she ever made). But kudos go to the magnificent Helen Hayes as the new addition to the family who stands up to Hale, John Beal, as her sensitive nephew who falls in love with her, and Robert Montgomery playing Hayes' husband, still under the control of his mother.

       " \"Based on a Broadway play, ANOTHER LANGUAGE is one of those gems from yesteryear that few have heard of. It has much to recommend it, chiefly: believable and detailed interaction among members of a rather large and unpleasant family, mostly given to self absorption but with moments of genuine compassion and caring that surface unexpectedly. One of the members of this family is Margaret Hamilton (who was in the Broadway original) in one of the few roles that allowed her to enact a somewhat complex human being. Louise Closser Hale is perfectly cast as the controlling, selfish mother who sets the tone for her whole brood. Helen Hayes, a supremely skilled actress who could play ordinary people and make them fascinating, wins the viewer over completely as the bride who runs afoul of her in-laws. I wanted to marry her myself! The standout, however, is young John Beal who delivers a passionate performance as Robert Montgomery's younger brother. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS*** His character is introduced well after the conflict between Hayes and the family is established. He is appalled that his family is treating Hayes so shabbily and falls madly, dangerously, recklessly in love with her. His vital, fresh-faced, youthful innocence and earnestness captivate the viewer. He too had played the same role in the stage version. This performance might have launched Beal to the top of the Hollywood firmament, but Hollywood didn't suit him, and he settled into a 60-year career of minor films, regional theater and numerous TV roles. Montgomery himself is top notch, as usual, playing the insensitive product of his narrow-minded mother's upbringing. Don't let the conventional opening scene as Hayes and Montgomery disembark from their honeymoon cruise fool you. It gets better fast. The theme is similar to that of HOLIDAY, based on a Philip Barry play, in which a free-spirited outsider clashes with members of his fiancée's stodgy, traditional banking family. Although not cinematically daring in any way, ANOTHER LANGUAGE delivers the emotional goods.\",\n",
       " \"A marvelous movie, from start to (just before the) finish.<br /><br />We meet Robert Montgomery and Helen Hayes, with whom he has eloped recently, on shipboard. She is eager to start their home life together. All he can think of is seeing his mother.<br /><br />Louise Closser Hale is superb as the suffocating matriarch of his family. The other members, including Henry Travers and Margaret Hamilton, are very good as well. Especially fine is John Beal, as Montgomery's nephew. Indeed, he gives a heart-wrenching performance. It's possibly the best in this movie and he is working against very stiff competition.<br /><br />Montgomery is not only a mama's boy -- called Vicky by everyone, as his name is Victor. He is also a supreme narcissist: In one shocking scene, he inspects himself in a mirror over the mantel. Directly under the mirror is a plaster bust of him that Hayes has lovingly worked on sculpting. He doesn't even notice it.<br /><br />It's very hard to fault this movie. The ending is a trifle disappointing. And a Mark Twain aphorism is spoken by one character and laughed at by others, as if it were original to this screenplay.<br /><br />Hayes is superb and very likable. Montgomery, not generally a favorite of mine, is believable as her self-centered husband. Beal is absolutely superb in a very touching role. And Hale is subtle but compelling as the woman of iron who becomes an invalid the minute doing so will get what she wants from her offspring.\",\n",
       " \"Only film geeks could get anything out of this piece of garabage! I meant to spell it that way by the way. Listen, anyway, this film premiered in Tulsa Oklahoma, with a pretty darn loyal following pretty darn excited to see it. It was awful! A complete waste of money. Felissa Rose was the only saving grace to this turkey about zombies who are sent from the devil. The acting is about the worst acting in cinema history, even Brink Stevens and Tom Savini couldn't save it! Ugh! 0/10\",\n",
       " 'Okay, I feel I must praise those who have given this film the bad rap it deserves! For starters, I remember getting invited to a special screening for, lets say, six bucks or so. I was expecting to see a wretched pile of bull, but I got something worse than that! I was so sure that having a few union actors such as Savini would give a little depth, or something enjoyable. NOPE! This film was the most pathetic concoction ever put onto film. Loust script, horrid acting, lame effects, and a whole lot of unreal violence that was just stupid to begin with. John Waters\\' \"Pink Flamingos\" looks like an early Spielberg classic in comparison, and thats a bad thing. I never had a problem with the Waters exercise in \\'poor taste\\', because there was a message about it, this film, was just stupid. I cannot be more specific than that. Just stupid.<br /><br />Now, it began out with an extremely unbelievable sex scene with Tom Savini and Brinke Stevens. Stevens then retreats to her radio office to conduct a question and answering about zombies. We then see the worst acting of a man and his son hunting zombies, and a tiger is involved...er something. Anyway, a community is under attack with a bunch of idiots running around getting killed one by one. The lead cops are sick and sleazy, and achieve sexual kicks by forcing young males to make love. It is just stupid I tell you! They don\\'t give a crap about civilians. I can understand a filmmakers need to be self-expressive, but there are limits to which art become ridiculous and repetitive. The rest of the story has a lot of bad acting, cheap vomit effects, dreadful dialog, and the STUPIDEST climax to be seen by anyone, be it whoever. My finale plea, is that the filmmakers of this movie need to be banned from writing, directing, or any other type of process in the industry. I thought I was going to see some film that would at least be on its way to a real film-festival...alas, this film was NOTHING! My advice would be to make sure NO ONE ever see\\'s this film again. Then the world would be a better place.<br /><br />I just have to ask...why do these films get made? They\\'re just so dumb, and offer nothing. If someone actually likes them, then they need help!',\n",
       " 'If you are a fan of Zombie-movies, this one will disappoint you: This is a movie without any good ideas, there are no thrills and shock-effects. The make-up is lousy, too and there was no money for special effects. The whole thing looks like a bad joke, a home video from a few crazy kids.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the actors who appear here you will be disappointed, too because their appearances are much too short.<br /><br />Zombiegeddon is a bad movie: very boring, no story, no, absolutely no action and a real waste of a few good B-movie-legends: Scream-Queen Brinke Stevens, she was about 50 when she made this one - real beauty never fades -, has a few good moments, Tom Savini, the legendary Sex-Machine in Tarantino/Rodriguez \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", is wasted here, too. His scene is not worth to mention and he isn\\'t as cool here as we remember him from other movies.<br /><br />\"Maniac Cop\" Robert Z\\'Dar appears almost at the end of the movie and he hasn\\'t much to do in here. Julie Strain appeared also in the credits and you wait for her appearance than you recognize disappointed that they only dubbed her voice as one of the callers.<br /><br />Conrad Brooks, the young Cop from Ed Woods \"Plan 9 from outer Space\", appears also here but why??? A few famous B-movie legends can\\'t even save this garbage.<br /><br />Joe Estevez seems to be the only actor who really enjoyed his work. His appearances are really funny. William Smith as Lord Zombie in his terrible costume with his terrible helmet looks like he would say: Oh my God, what am I doing here? When will I ever get a part in a real movie? Most of the scenes look like they were shot in 1 or 2 hours. Another funny thing is that the makers talk in the Making-Of about Kung-fu fighting Zombies, but what they are doing is Kickboxing. Hey, Guys, wake up! There is a difference between Kung-Fu and Kickboxing.<br /><br />This DVD includes also one of the worst and most boring Making-Ofs I\\'ve ever seen. It looks like even the guys who mad this movie were completely desinterrested in their \"work\".<br /><br />All in all: Zombiegeddon is a waste of time and a waste of money!',\n",
       " 'The movie isn\\'t worth much of my time. It is total crap. I rented this movie because it has Tom Savini listed at the top of the credits and had kung-fu zombies. Savini was in the movie for about 5 minutes. The kung-fu zombie scene was short and poorly done. I should have looked farther down and saw that Lloyd Kaufman was is this movie. The I would have realized that this is a piece of crap Troma movie.<br /><br />It is a piece of crap isn\\'t very funny. My two laughs: 1) Uwe Boll came on before the movie started and said \"this movie sucks\" and \"don\\'t watch it\". I started thinking: \"I wouldn\\'t trust Uwe\\'s opinion on a zombie film.\" 2) The police were a little funny when they were framing someone.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was total crap. There were a bunch of cameos from B movie stars and a bunch of bad attempts to intentionally make scenes look unintentionally bad. I was wired up when the movie started from winning a close softball game 15-14, but this movie put me to near sleep within 10 minutes. Do watch it. It is bad.',\n",
       " 'Not as bad as \"Bone Sickness\"<br /><br />well ...yeah it is.<br /><br />This movie is bad.<br /><br />Very bad!!!<br /><br />The director did\\'nt even want his name on it but put it on it since the crew asked him to. That should be all you need to know.<br /><br />I love horror ...just so you know. I love a lot of really bad horror, but this is not the good kind of bad in any way. Don\\'t spend any money on this flick. By \"any money\" I mean \"ANY\" ! A penny would be too much. You have been warned!',\n",
       " 'Before seeing this movie, i did expect it to be a no budget \"so bad its good\" zombie flick. What i saw was a lot worse. First of all Zombiegeddon has a very dull script - Lord Zombie (William Smith) is creating human-like zombies and sends them to Earth. This is just pathetic. I don\\'t understand why in hell did people like Edwin Neal, Tom Savini, Brinke Stevens, Felissa Rose, Linnea Quigley, Robert Z\\'Dar and Joe Estevez even appear in this movie. Edwin Neal plays God. Tom Savini plays Jesus Crist. Robert Z\\'Dar appears for only 5 mins, and even makes fun of his own cult movie The Maniac Cop !<br /><br />The effects are cheap, and unrealistic. Awful soundtrack. The directing is even worse. Zombie make-up is none-existent. Some zombies are kickboxers, and kung-fu fighters. The acting is beyond bad. In the beginning of the movie, director Uwe Boll tells us not to watch this movie, because its bad. Well after seeing Zombiegeddon i\\'ll have to admit, he was right. His House of the Dead was better than this. <br /><br />So, to sum it up - don\\'t watch this movie. Its really that bad. And believe me, i\\'ve seen bad movies. This one is worse than Zombie Lake, Flesheaters, Bloodeaters, Meat Market, Redneck Zombies, Bone Sickness...etc. All of the B-movie stars listed above appear for only a couple of minutes each. Other actors are absolutely awful. The movie isn\\'t funny, isn\\'t scary, isn\\'t interesting, isn\\'t shocking. The only movie i can think of right now, that is worse than Zombiegeddon is probably Zombiez. 1/10',\n",
       " 'IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS, DO NOT READ ON. THANK YOU.<br /><br />I\\'ll be honest with you. I went into the video store looking for something mildly bad, but funny enough to keep myself entertained. The DVD starts off hilariously, with a rapidly-moving movie about zombie chickens, making me laugh in hilarity. This went on for so long, I was happily munching on my hot pocket... until it said it was a preview. This was followed by another long one, which, thanks to the genius programmers, I couldn\\'t skip passed, so I had to FastForward. Then I finally got to the menu, which surprised me, to be frank. For the price I got it at, I wasn\\'t expecting that much. The movie started with Lloyd Kaufman, an eccentric Jewish man who is the father of a few cult films, which made me excited. Generally, anything with Troma on it will elicit a \"what?\" response, which is what keeps me going. After Kaufman speaks with a few cute girls at some horror expo, the movie begins. Well, not quite. After play, some guys talk about how big a, I quote exactly, a \"POS\" this movie was. This goes on for awhile until I skip ahead.<br /><br />First thing I can\\'t help but notice is that the camera and lighting work is about as good as your typical soap opera, and sometimes won\\'t even sit still.<br /><br />The movie starts off jarringly, but no one cares. Two cops kill a guy, and put in some framing guns, though later they just shoot people for fun. Not even five minutes in, a woman disrobes, meaning someone is about to die. Naked chicks are always a signal something big is about to go down. They\\'re in the gym of a community college, and one of them, I\\'ll say, isn\\'t particularly bad to look at. any arousal is quickly doused by the biker-chick esquire woman who supposedly gets hit on a lot. All of this is just filler, until the cuter woman goes in the shower, disappears when a hand grabs her, and some juice is tossed at the shower wall. I should mention, the sound is appalling in this scene. It\\'s not award winning in any others, but the gym is inexcusable. Kaufman also plays an overacting janitor, supposedly has the biggest case of homophobia on earth because he thinks, I\\'m not kidding, that a man being eaten by another man is totally normal, homosexual behavior.<br /><br />These zombies are not really zombies at all. They can choose to reveal themselves, they are sentient, intelligent, and well skilled in combat. Hell, they\\'re demons, I have no idea where they got zombies from. We learn this when a guy who hates late fees kills the clerk by cheaply ripping his heart out, and eating it when charged.<br /><br />We return to the cops, who may as well be named Good Cop and Bad Cop, since it doesn\\'t matter. I actually had to take notes throughout this whole thing, and to run through them all would fill up the amount of characters I have available. so, I\\'ll lay out a few of the more glaring memories: There\\'s a pointless scene where the bad cop humps to orgasm a car driven by a group of four college kids after belittling them. There\\'s also a lengthy conversation about testicles and the eating of said organs. There\\'s also a running comment that no one should be in the college \"at these hours,\" often through a truly pointless subplot about some jerk-turned-good guy who saves a girl he likes, who works inventory at a book store. despite the implication that it is pretty late at night, it\\'s always broad daylight outside. Most of the killing early on is done by the Bad cop, who is in fact a good guy. The zombies are also major wusses, who can be defeated by a few punches. There\\'s a half decent fight scene between Sensei Zombie (a kung fu master undead) and the good cop after they rescue three useless girls. After this, they go into a safe house occupied by God. Despite being a safe house, every one inside it eventually dies. There\\'s a few other things, I could mention, but I\\'d like to skip to the ultimate fight of good v. evil: Good cop is supposedly a warrior of God, because of his blood line. He fights the head zombie, which consists of him getting his punch caught, and then ripping the head zombie\\'s heart out. Think they could\\'ve made this scene, the climax, a bit more interesting? I don\\'t know. The movie ends with the guy getting gunned down, and zombies swarming the world.<br /><br />Wow. This is one of the first movies they ever made me stare at the screen speechless, before bursting out into laughter. \"What the hell is this?\"<br /><br />What is this? This is a major piece of crap. If you\\'re a fan of that, well, perhaps you should look into it. But, the main stream movie-goer will probably want to commit suicide after watching this, so by all means avoid.<br /><br />Main stream: 1/10 <br /><br />Masochistic Movie-Geek: 10/10',\n",
       " \"I have to say when a name like Zombiegeddon and an atom bomb on the front cover I was expecting a flat out chop-socky fung-ku, but what I got instead was a comedy. So, it wasn't quite was I was expecting, but I really liked it anyway! The best scene ever was the main cop dude pulling those kids over and pulling a Bad Lieutenant on them!! I was laughing my ass off. I mean, the cops were just so bad! And when I say bad, I mean The Shield Vic Macky bad. But unlike that show I was laughing when they shot people and smoked dope.<br /><br />Felissa Rose...man, oh man. What can you say about that hottie. She was great and put those other actresses to shame. She should work more often!!!!! I also really liked the fight scene outside of the building. That was done really well. Lots of fighting and people getting their heads banged up. FUN! Last, but not least Joe Estevez and William Smith were great as the...well, I wasn't sure what they were, but they seemed to be having fun and throwing out lines. I mean, some of it didn't make sense with the rest of the flick, but who cares when you're laughing so hard! All in all the film wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I wasn't expecting that. It was a Troma flick so I figured it would totally suck. It's nice when something surprises you but not totally sucking.<br /><br />Rent it if you want to get stoned on a Friday night and laugh with your buddies. Don't rent it if you are an uptight weenie or want a zombie movie with lots of flesh eating.<br /><br />P.S. Uwe Boil was a nice touch.\",\n",

OK it have a lot bad things like : no budget (of course), no good acting, no fancy FX, no good location, no good editing, no good sound.....etc In fact, in all technical aspect, the film is bad, but that\\'s not a surprise. But when you watch Zombiegeddon a lot of this disappear or make the film pretty funny. And that\\'s the power of this movie, the film is fun, good fun. Because it\\'s not an annoying and boring movie, no that\\'s more a good horror/comedy, between \"shawn of the dead\" and \"an Ed Wood movie\". And that\\'s really enjoying to see a movie like that make you smile at least 75% of the time. The movie is really cool. Great Troma movie !',\n",
       " \"I got a screener of this film a couple of weeks ago. Before I watched it I checked out this site and instantly began to dread watching it. I finally gave up last night and threw it in. What were these other reviewers watching? Is it the same film? One mentions he thought the movie, called ZOMBIEGEDDON for Christ's sake, might be a film festival flick. I'm wondering now if this person needed glasses to read the title. Do movies with cheesy titles usually go to film festivals? If so, which one so I can go! Then there's one saying that they weren't warned like they are with a John Waters film...um, did you see the warning at the beginning of the film? Or listen to Uwe Boll in the opening? It makes me think some of these reviews are fake. One of the best zombie movies? Nooo, not even the positive ones seem like they've seen it. What you do get here is a real weird ass zombie film, if you can even call it a zombie film. After the warnings on how bad it is from Uwe Boll and retard doctors (I'm serious) you get Brinke Stevens humping Tom Savini. You get in on the tail end of the sex and then some brief nudity and a few cute one liners from Savini. Then Savini is gone. Perhaps my biggest beef with the film is the in and out cameos. The people I want to see more of only have brief scenes and then there's those that annoy me to no end that we have to see for the whole film. I suppose that's how you get a great crap cast though...After the sex, Brinke goes to her job at the radio station and is provoked into telling how all of mankind will be dead in so many hours. The movie then goes into all these different and sometimes intersecting stories that add up to a bunch of Z grade actors getting killed by zombies. I have to admit it and definitely hate to, but I kind of liked this film. It's guaranteed to get trashed, as it is on this site but there's something offbeat and weird about this film that makes me love it. Maybe it's the cameos from people I love or the pure ballsiness to seemingly not care what people are going to think of the film, like when they gave it such a cheeseball title (probably not expecting people to confuse it with art-house fare like one reviewer did). I found myself smiling through most of the film. That doesn't happen very often. I laughed out loud two or three times and a few more times at the horrible delivery of some of the actors but I'd be shocked if 80's B movie fans didn't enjoy this film if they're willing to accept it for what it is. It's a movie that obviously had no budget, hopefully made by young people. If it's by young people then this movie is OK. If the makers of this film have been around for a while you should probably stop. What sold me on the movie is just the weirdness of it. I really don't have any other way to put it. The actors are crap, the movie looks like good digital, there's nothing special about the way it's filmed or edited, the make up is probably good for no budget but not for something with a budget so all this movie ends up having going for it is it's weirdness. Luckily, it's one weird arse movie.\",\n",
       " \"I saw this in Pittsburgh PA in a small theater there. This movie was a lot of fun with tons of B movie stars and references. A total blast from start to finish with everything you'd expect from a low budget movie. Brinke Stevens, Robert Z'Dar, Edwin Neal, and Tom Savini are especially good. This is by far the most fun I've had at the movies in years!\",\n",
       " \"I caught this bad boy at a showing in a Tulsa Oklahoma theater. The title made me think I was getting in for a cheesefest. Conrad Brooks is in it too so it has to be REALLY bad doesn't it? Well, no. See what makes this flick stand out is that it's far different from anything else I've seen. It's not Romero that's for sure. Think Romero with a little Lloyd Kaufman with a little Larry Cohen. I sat through the entire film and was not bored. That does not happen very often. At one point things in the film are happening so fast it felt chaotic and that's exactly what I'd imagine the filmmakers wanted you to feel. They wanted you to actually get in the movie. Now I don't want to sound like I'm totally praising the film because it's not THAT good but it's not bad either. It's one of those low budget shot on video horror films so how can you go in expecting much? Then we've got the title and the fact Conrad Brooks and Joe Estevez are in it. How can you expect much? What you can expect is a good time. I think anyone who actually knows this convention like list of horror stars will have an absolute blast. If you're looking for A grade acting with an incredible beautiful story go rent Hamlet. If you're looking for a nasty good time rent Zombiegeddon.\",\n",
       " 'I had not heard of the film until I saw it on the Turner Movie Classics schedule. Seeing the subject matter and the 1944 date excited me. The writer, director and cast would be playing out the issues in real time, as the die was cast. I grew up in a household conflicted with stories and opinions of Nazi Germany. My mother is Jewish. My father was German and raised by a father who supported Hitler. I have always been fascinated by Germans who seem to be good people who choose to ignore the eventual outcome of Hitler\\'s madness and defend Germany\\'s need for him.<br /><br />The characters each have their unique perspective and reaction to Emil as played masterfully by Skip Homeier. The desire to see only the good in a human being with no expectation that they are dealing with a fully brainwashed evil acting thug is such an American trait. This movie is simply made and concentrates closely on the story, and it\\'s the story and the acting that is compelling. I think you will enjoy it if you enjoy a good psychological study. My husband was disappointed with the ending, I, however, was overjoyed and cried. P. S. It was nice to see Agnes Moorehead in her role. I have never seen her play such a \"normal person\".',\n",
       " '\"Tomorrow the World\" is a thought provoking film about an American family who adopts a troubled German boy after the war. Together they try to undo the ridgid Nazi influence that was instilled in him (which is no easy feat). Leslie Fenton directs a first rate cast including Fredric March, Betty Field, Agnes Moorehead and Joan Carroll. However it is Skip Homeier as the Nazi youth who steals the picture with an electrifying performance. The film is available on video and DVD.',\n",
       " 'One must make allowances -- it was wartime, it was propaganda, it was United Artists -- but even taking all that into account, this is a fairly ludicrous melodrama about an upper-middle-class American household that brings chaos on itself by unknowingly inviting a Hitler Youth into its home. And what a little hellraiser he turns out to be -- writing anti-Semitic epithets about his teacher and potential stepmom (Field), whacking his cousin(Carroll) with a fireplace iron, attempting to knife a playmate. Adapted by no less than Ring Lardner Jr. from a hit Broadway play, it may have had resonance at the time, if audiences were willing to overlook pedestrian direction, absurdly melodramatic music, and Homeier\\'s undisciplined histrionics (reprising his stage role, he\\'s sort of a Nazi Dennis the Menace). But the script, like so many at the time, takes the goodness of Americans, all Americans, so for granted that it starts to sound smug and patronizing. (It\\'s a mighty white-bread America they\\'re portraying, too; if that\\'s how things really were, it looks today like an unwitting expose of America\\'s racist past.) It also suggests that it\\'s fairly easy to deprogram these little monsters; all it takes is a bit of lovingkindness and a birthday present. March and Moorehead (playing a repressed spinster aunt, much like she did in \"The Magnificent Ambersons\") were as good as movie actors get, but they\\'re playing devices here, not flesh and blood. Under the circumstances, Betty Field manages to be surprisingly interesting -- she always looks so worried, like she has a horrible secret the audience never finds out.',\n",
       " '\"Tomorrow the World\", the play in which this picture is based, was popular on Broadway during the WWII era. It was to expect it made it to the movies. Ring Lardner Jr, one of the best American writers of the time undertook the film adaptation aided by Leopold Atlas. Leslie Fenton, the director made the best of it.<br /><br />An American family living in the midwest accept to house and care for a German youth whose father was friendly with the head of the household, Mike Frame, a widower, with a teen age daughter. <br /><br />When Emil Bruckner arrives, he immediately makes a blunder when he describes his plane trip seated next to a fat Jew. Well, little does this little brat know that Mike is seeing a school teacher who happens to be Jewish. Leona Richards is the epitome of kindness and patience. So is Pat, the daughter who tries to show Emil around and help him make friends in her circle. Emil does everything possible to destroy this family that welcomed him into their home. Little by little he tries to get his way until everybody finds out this little boy is a bully and a coward.<br /><br />The cast of this 1944 movie is headed by the great Frederic March, one of the icons of the American theater and the film industry. He plays the decent Mike Frame. Betty Field makes an impressive appearance as the kind Lee Richards. Agnes Moorehead, is also good as Aunt Jessie, who is charmed by the rotten Emil. Skip Homeier, repeating his theater role is remarkable as the young Nazi sympathizer who gets a lesson in how wrong he has been about his American hosts.<br /><br />This is a movie that has a dated look, but still makes an impression because of the strength of the treatment it received from the writers and the director.',\n",
       " 'This is an entertaining and interesting film, as much for what it doesn\\'t say as for what it does.<br /><br />Our depiction of small town middle American life circa 1944 is wildly inaccurate and glorified, but this is not at all unusual in films of the era. World War II era audiences would have considered themselves morally superior to the Germans and had no argument with life as seen in \"Tomorrow, the World!\". In reality, however, it is unlikely that a Jewish woman would have been a teacher in a largely protestant public school, and even less likely that she would have entered into an interfaith marriage with the only protest being raised by a small foreign boy. And if one considers how the story would have played out had the character of Leona been black, she not only would have never been teaching in a white public school, but had she and Mike Frame sought to be married, there likely would have been a response from the community that involved a lynching and thus our moral superiority over the Germans is exposed as being more imagined than real.<br /><br />None of which particularly ruins the film. It requires no greater suspended-disbelief than Superman or Dracula, and on its own merits this film is an enjoyable experience. However sanitized, small town 1940\\'s America is a place one almost cannot help but to long for. And into this idealized world enters Emil, a character that at first comes on ludicrously overplayed, and yet pulls you in just the same. The audience quickly becomes concerned for what will happened to the Frame family, and the guilty pleasure of watching this pre-\"Bad Seed\" demon will keep you on the edge of your seat.. After what Emil does to Pat, the vigilante justice meted out by Pat\\'s school-mates is shamelessly gratifying to see. Throughout the story one keeps secretly hoping for Emil\\'s redemption, and it is the film\\'s greatest drawback that it attempts to grant this wish in a quick and unrealistic throwaway end. This inadequately explored issue as well as the intriguing and thoroughly under-utilized subplot of Emil\\'s manipulation of Jessie leave the distinct impression that someone demanded a great deal of running time be shaved off of this film.<br /><br />\"Tomorrow, the World!\" still gets major points for at least attempting a subject matter few films of its era, outside of propaganda newsreels, would dare touch, and it\\'s worth a watch.',\n",
       " 'I saw this movie and found it extremely puzzling. The child, Emil, is the least sympathetic character I have seen since, \"The Good Son.\" Emil is cold, calculating and manipulates the other characters with no conscience whatsoever.<br /><br />I found the ending the most curious of all. Emil attempts to murder Pat, and because he cries over it, and confesses the Nazis kept him in a dark cell for what his father did, the family forgives all. This seems to be a recipe for disaster. The end credits roll, but does anyone believe a kid that tried to kill before won\\'t try to do it again when he doesn\\'t get his way? Nuts!',\n",
       " '**SPOILERS** Coming over to the Frame home in rural USA to be taken in as a member of the family young Emil Buckner, Skip Homeier, is anything but your typical American boy in fact he was brought up in Nazi Germany and brainwashed to grow up and become a future Aryan Superman in the Hitler Youth. That fact that Emil\\'s dad who was thrown into a Nazi concentration camp where he eventually died for speaking out against the Fuhrer, Adolph Hitler, made Emil look suspicious to his Nazi overseers who felt that he may well become like his dad, normal, when he grows up. The Nazis decided that he didn\\'t have what it takes to become a good and loyal member of the Nazi Party and sent packing to the US to stay with his old man\\'s brother-in-law Mike Frame, Fredic March, and his future wife Leona Richards, Betty Fields.<br /><br />Not getting the hint that he was a total wash out, in him not having what it takes to be a good Nazi, from his beloved Nazi Germany Emil ,because of him being brainwashed since he could barley walk, still thinks that he\\'s a full fledged Nazi Superman and goes so far as to parade around the house, this in 1944 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany, with his Nazi or Hitler Youth uniform. Emil makes a complete jerk of himself in him trying to be a spy for the Fatherland and at the same time blowing his cover, by bragging about it, and not realizing that the Fatherland, wanting nothing at all to do with this nut, had him unceremoniously kicked out!<br /><br />Acting like a Nazified version of \"Dennis the Menace\" Emil is all over the house and even at school trying to prove to everyone, including himself, what a great Nazi Superman he really is. For a while Emil does get his classmates to go along with his crazy antics that he picked up back in Germany while in the Hitler Youth. Emil has his classmates take night marches into enemy territory and staging roadside ambushes, all in fun of course, while being disguised in camouflage so that the enemy, whoever he is, can\\'t see them as well as familiarizing themselves with all kinds of arms and ammunitions, German of course.<br /><br />Emil goes a bit too far when he first comes to deal with Leona, his Uncle Mike\\'s fiancée, being Jewish as well as his determination to steal Mike\\'s mail that he gets from the War Department. Mike is one of the country\\'s top chemist and is working on a top secret project for the US military, the Atomic Bomb?, and Emil wants to get his hands on what he\\'s doing by stealing his private notes and mail and send it back to the Fatherland. In the case of his future aunt Leona the fact that she\\'s Jewish is enough to drive Emil batty in thinking that he\\'ll be forced to live under the same roof as she is when she marries his Uncle Mike: a fate worse then death itself for the cute but somewhat not all there in the head little Nazi. <br /><br />Two things happen that turn Emil around in his mission, or what he thinks it is, in serving his Fatherland. Confronting Leona about her being Jewish, in the most vulgar of ways, she slaps Emil across the face that shocks the very self-assured and arrogant young man in him, ,an Aryan Superman, not only being whacked by a lowly woman but a Jewish one at that! The second incident that brings Emil back to reality has to do with his getting into a fight with fellow student Stanley Dumbowski, Rudy Wissle. Stanley being a Polish/American whom Emil felt to be inferior to him was able to take him on and give him a bloody nose and even later force Emil, with their teacher Miss. Richards looking on, to apologies to him in front of all his classmates; What An Insult!<br /><br />With all his arrogance about being a good Nazi now in question the only thing that can bring back Emil to his fantasy world of serving Fuhrer and Fatherland is to get his hands on Uncle Mike\\'s secret papers and send them back to Germany, by US airmail?, to show everyone back home what a good German, or Aryan, he really is. Emil is stymied in his plan to serve the Fatherland when he\\'s caught red-handed, with his hands in Uncle Mike\\'s drawer, by his young cousin Pattie, Joan Carroll, who just bought him a birthday present, a illuminated watch which he always wanted for his crazy nighttime war maneuvers. All at once Emil graduated from just being just a pesky and uncontrollable but somewhat harmless young boy to a possibly up and coming psycho killer the very type of person that would make those back in the Fatherland, the Nazis, very proud of him.<br /><br />Intriguing movie about how a young man can be so seriously brainwashed that he goes against his best interests to serve a country and ideology, Nazi Germany, that did nothing but harm him and his family. Where at the same time having him try to destroy, in his own childless way, the country and its people that did nothing but help him in every way it and they could despite his dislike of both of them.<br /><br />Emil does see the light at the end the movie, or tunnel, in how he was treated by his Uncle Mike and especially Leona, a Jew who in his mind is the eternal enemy of his beloved Third Reich, as well as his victim of violence Pattie in the kindness and understanding as well as love that they all showed to him.This kindness and understanding is something that he never would have gotten, if he did what he did here back there, in Nazi Germany.',\n",
       " 'This was a film that got a rather high score in the Leonard Maltin Guide--saying the film was \"still potent\". Well, I was excited about seeing it, as I love American WWII propaganda films and have seen a huge number of them. Unfortunately, while the original stage production of the play and the subsequent movie made quite a splash, the whole thing seems terribly dated and poorly written today. The bottom line is that the film lacks subtlety and has plot holes big enough to fly a B-17 through them! The movie begins well enough, as Frederic March (a fine actor) is in the lead. But my hopes were soon dashed when the little Nazi boy (Emil) comes to live with them. First, it\\'s hard to imagine the Nazis letting a boy leave the country to come to the US while we are at war with them! Secondly, it\\'s hard to imagine the US government just accepting the kid without making sure he wasn\\'t a spy or an America-hater. But regardless, here appears a 12 year-old boy who often sounds quite German (he uses German and English interchangeably) but his accent also wavers a bit--almost sounding Swedish or Polish from time to time. I guess you can\\'t blame him that much, as this is a VERY demanding role for a young boy. But who you can blame are the writers who immediately throw subtlety out the window. Instead of the kid pretending to love America or creating trust with his new family, he immediately acts like the local chairman of the Hitler fan club--even showing up to his first meal dressed in full Hitler Youth regalia (including an armband). Now I don\\'t know about you, but if I\\'d been alive during the war and a kid moved in with me and preceded to parade around the house in Nazi uniform spouting hate, I think I\\'d be a bit peeved! But, March and the rest try to show him understanding instead of turning the brat over to the FBI!! Plus, while March works on top-secret military plans, he does a lousy job of securing them so Emil isn\\'t able to steal them. Also, you\\'d think when he went to school and began spreading hate and Nazi propaganda that the school would have taken more notice. No trip to the principal\\'s office, no phone calls home and no contact with the local police. It just defies all common sense to think that during the war anyone would have been allowed to act this way without being arrested is crazy. America DOES have freedom of speech, but for a foreign national spreading pro-Nazi propaganda during the war, this is ridiculous! Now if this was the only problem with the film, I guess you could chalk it up to naiveté. Unfortunately, it got a lot worse. Emil spread anger and dissent everywhere but no one actually did anything about this...so far, so good. BUT, after 1001 warning signs AND when he then tries to kill two people (by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another), you\\'d think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot! But, in one of the worst endings in film history, they stupid family feels sorry for the kid and decides, like the Beatles once said, \"all you need is love\". To make matters worse, the girl who was beaten with the poker was March\\'s own kid and the lady who convinces March not to press charges in the end was his Jewish fiancée!! Yecch!!! What drivel. The film just doesn\\'t make sense and becomes tiresome because of all this.',\n",
       " \"Fast transfer of a smash WWII B'way play is both fascinating and unintentionally ludicrous. An OTT idea ('typical' American family take in a German refugee relative and find an unrepentant Nazi Youth!) is given an OTT treatment, right down to Louis Applebaum's balmy background score. Character actor turned megger Leslie Fenton can't camouflage a penny-pinching budget and he certainly doesn't hold the actors down. (Skippy Homeier's award-winning perf as the Nazi boy is berserk.) Yet he pulls off a remarkable chase/fight climax that's like something out of F. W. Murnau. Even Henry Sharp's lensing comes to life, recalling his glory days shooting Doug Fairbanks classics & THE CROWD. (Bump down your brightness level to increase the 'grey scale' on this Image DVD edition.) With naturalism out of the question, pros like Fredric March, Betty Field & Agnes Moorehead all succumb to heightened stage manners, but they still can't pull off the simplistic humanistic psychological ending. The story might make a bit more sense if the kid remained the monstrous automaton we first meet. Put on your own double bill with Roger Corman's THE INTRUDER/'61 and see who decides to follow the Leader.\",\n",

       " \"One of my favorite films of all-time. Unusual because the pirates depicted in this movie are all too real. None of the romanticizing Errol Flynn or Jack Sparrow stuff. These pirates were shockingly ruthless and a real sense of danger permeates the film. Yul Brynner and Kirk Douglas bring intensity to their roles. Brynner as the egotistic sociopath who is the leader of the cutthroats and Douglas as a man who must deal with a desperate situation in a fight for survival. Samantha Eggar as a woman with flawed instincts for her own preservation evokes frustration and pity. From the brutal opening scenes, the message is clear that these pirates don't play. A sense of urgency then takes over until the final outcome. A great movie!\",\n",
       " \"Once I overlooked the slow moving action (at times) and hokey plot and dialogue, I found this movie really entertaining in a circus and carnival (freaky pirates, treasure, monkey, violence, wild colors in a rough landscape with spaghetti western flashbacks) sort of way. Seemed to really push the envelope for that time period in terms of gay and trans-gender undertones - what with the pirate captain's attachment to his butler and to his androgynous second in command (the character who paraded around in a dress and feathers and appeared much more interested in Will than in Arabella). I didn't even sense that the pirate captain was attracted to Arabella in a sexual way. Anyway,that made the movie all the more interesting and unique - although likely far removed from what Jules Verne envisioned.\",\n",
       " \"The Light At The Edge of the World marks Kirk Douglas's second filming of a Jules Verne novel. The first of course was one of his most popular films 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. But this film is far more serious and has far more adult themes than Walt Disney's film aimed for the kid trade.<br /><br />This was the last novel Jules Verne had published during his lifetime and it's a story of survival against almost impossible odds. In the original novel Kirk Douglas's character was named Vasquez which certainly was more in keeping with someone assigned to lighthouse duty on Cape Horn. But in giving Douglas's character an Anglo name it better explains his presence on the island and it certainly is in keeping with the international tradition of Jules Verne's writings.<br /><br />Cape Horn is one of the loneliest parts of the globe and the geography of the southern tip of South America. Look on a map of the many islands and rocks in that part of the globe and imagine how rough the sea is because it has only limited space. It's not without reason that sailors in all cultures say that no one is really a true sailor until they've made a voyage crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean in that area. Remember also this is 1865 as Yul Brynner identifies the year and the Panama Canal had not been built.<br /><br />Which makes the lighthouse at Cape Horn an international concern which was something that is ever present in Jules Verne's writings. But then as now there are malevolent forces in the world and they are in this story Yul Brynner and his pirate crew.<br /><br />On one desultory like any other down there, Yul Brynner's ship docks at the island and kills lighthouse keeper Fernando Rey and his young assistant Massimo Ranieri. By sheer dumb luck Douglas is not at the lighthouse when this happens, but he becomes a hunted man by Brynner and his pirate crew who want to set up headquarters there and use the light to pile up as many wrecks as they can plunder. Also they want to eliminate Douglas who's now the only witness to their crimes.<br /><br />I did like this film very much both when first seeing it in the theater and now on VHS. One thing of interest I found here is that there is no ambiguity, no shadings of character. Kirk Douglas is a good guy and Yul Brynner a bad one, no one is going to walk away thinking anything else. In fact Yul Brynner's pirate captain Jonathan Kongre is the most unredeemable villain we've seen on screen since Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance.<br /><br />Definitely fans of Kirk Douglas, Yul Brynner and Jules Verne should earmark this film for their collection.\",\n",
       " \"Surprising that Jules Verne would write such a story. Even more surprising that Hollywood would produce it. Yul Brynner is unbelievably good as a man freed of all bounds of convention, free to indulge his taste for cruelty and domination. Douglass is an excellent counterpoint, a courageous individual who's chosen simple solitude as a way to deal with the complications and turmoil society had imposed on him. And Samantha Egger's character is the capper, a woman willing to sacrifice far too much for comfort and safety. Inotherwords, everyman. The movie does show its age and is limited by the conventions of time and place and technology of the time. If you're looking for special effects and action as substitutes for thought, look elsewhere.\",\n",
       " 'Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker\\'s Soul\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it\\'s sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.<br /><br />Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne\\'s son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \"JONATHAN\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne\\'s lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.<br /><br />Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he\\'s from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre\\'s right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won\\'t do it. <br /><br />Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre\\'s activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.<br /><br />Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne\\'s stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \"Jonathan\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner\\'s performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton\\'s ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women\\'s clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne\\'s theme.',\n",
       " \"it is a quite slow pace face-to-face Brynner/Douglas...i found there was some pretty heavy violence/gore but you know, seventies giallo style : (maybe some spoiler ahead) a little bit phony and fake but the image is there : the monkey torn apart, the flesh torn from the mechanic, etc...<br /><br />i don't remember if it is alike the novel...but overall i think it is a OK action flick, hero flick : he stands all alone at the end, all the bad guys are out..........<br /><br />and nice images too : a small rocky island, the sun over the sea<br /><br />but not a typical Verne's story-on-cinema : subs, sci-fi; but the adventure seen in a lot of Verne's novels tough\",\n",

She brought believability to the role and dept to the character.

Regardless because I think I might decide to watch another one of her films if they turn up on TV in the near future. Although the film doesn't cross the creepy line and we don't get to see any goodies of any such nature, shannon does look remarkably good. Wasn't a fan of her in 90210 (in kelly/jennies camp) or charmed (never seen it) but loved scare tactics. like the summary states, there was one too many twists leading to the climax and it did seemed force feed as you don't really see whats happening to who and remember who was crossed etc etc.\",\n",

The one obvious opportunity to display any kind of emotion was when she discovered that she had been conned by a trusted friend, but no, an expression of anger seemed to be too difficult, so instead we get nothing.

They need two million dollars to buy the house they never had - having grown up as orphaned children. On one of their scams they employ a secretary and medical student named Georgie, who is convinced they are raising money for an orphans project.

       " \"Take a couple of con men who see an opportunity to separate a mark from his money in just about everything, throw in an attractive young woman with an altruistic agenda, blend together for about ninety-three minutes and the result is `Shooting Fish,' an amiable, entertaining comedy, directed by Stefan Schwartz. It's the story of two guys who grew up in orphanages on opposite sides of the ocean, Dylan (Dan Futterman) in America, Jez (Stuart Townsend) in England; and who, by the time they had reached the age of consent, had each been endowed with a particular talent: Dylan has the gift of gab, Jez is a technical wizard. Dylan's gift has quickly gotten him into hot water with the wrong kind of people, however, and to stay healthy (read: `Alive') he flees to England, where he meets Jez. And it's a friendship/partnership born in scam/scheme heaven. If there's a way to make a fast buck, they know it-- from selling bogus computers, to selling insulation for homes that's never installed, to entering any and every contest that comes down the pike. If there's a nickel in it, they're in.<br /><br />\\tThen one day they hire a girl from the temp pool to help them out with one of their scams. Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is beautiful, smart, and has a cause she's trying to fund, so she needs the job; but from day one she's on to what Dylan and Jez are trying to pull. She stays on board, however, when Dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day Robin Hoods-- that the money they're `raising' is going to orphans. What he doesn't tell her is that the `orphans' he's referring to is them. And Dylan is a born salesman-- not to mention the fact that he's a real charmer-- and the three of them become a real team. <br /><br />\\tSchwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable, but it is entertaining. It's exactly what it promises to be: a diverting hour and a half or so that provides some laughs and a good time. It's pleasant fare that's inoffensive and features some engaging performances and a story that will keep you involved. There are a couple of scenes, in fact, that are downright hilarious. And Schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along, which, when you add it all up, makes for a satisfying, enjoyable experience.<br /><br />\\tFutterman has a winning personality and a resonant, mesmerizing voice that fits his character perfectly. Dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet, because if you do, chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge. He's a likable heel, convincingly brought to life by Futterman (who is probably best known for his role of Vincent Gray in the `Judging Amy' TV series). It's a good performance, and one of the strengths of the film.<br /><br />\\tAs Jez, Townsend does a fine job, too, and though he's overshadowed a bit by Dylan-- intentionally the flashier of the two-- Jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience. After all, this is the guy who at least seems a bit remorseful as he's taking other people's money and trust. And it's interesting to compare Townsend's fairly reserved performance here with his role of the vampire Lestat in the more recent `Queen of the Damned.' He's a fine young actor whose style contrasts nicely with Futterman, and along with Beckinsale they make quite the team of scam artists.<br /><br />\\tThe one who draws the attention, however, is the lovely and charismatic Kate Beckinsale, who is beguiling in the role of Georgie. She makes her character accessible, and plays her with a savvy, rather than naive sensibility, and it's a portrayal that works well. Most importantly, she makes Georgie real, with a winsome appeal that makes you care about her and what happens to her. She's the most grounded of the trio, and it's her character that keeps the story within the realm of credibility. This may not be the stuff Oscars are made of, but it's an enjoyable, engaging performance that will win you over, without question.<br /><br />\\tThe supporting cast includes Rowena Cooper (Jez's Teacher), Myles Anderson (Jez, aged 8), Jacob Macoby (Dylan, aged 8), Jane Lapotaire (Dylan's Headmistress), Tom Chadbon (Mr. Greenaway), Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Ross), Peter McNamara (Geoff), Arabella Weir (Mrs. Stratton-Luce), Nickolas Grace (Mr. Stratton-Luce) and Claire Cox (Floss). An easy-going comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes, `Shooting Fish' is a solid, feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment. And in the final analysis, that's not such a bad deal; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10.\",\n",
       " \"Normally when it comes to voting for movies on the IMDb, I'm quite liberal. I don't set very high standards for movies. I always tend to rate films based on how much I enjoy them and this means that most of the time I always rate films highly cos I try and find something good in every film I see. I saw this film when I was vacationing in England. BBC One actually transmitted this at 11 PM, since they believed that The Peacemaker was a film more deserving of the 9:00 slot. Unlike the Peacemaker, Shooting Fish is a film that almost anybody would enjoy, unless he/she was the kind of person who found simple effective storytelling a turnoff.<br /><br />Everything about this movie seems in perfect harmony. The chemistry between Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend is perfect, word for word. And Kate Beckinsale is a perfect third piece to the puzzle; When the conversations in the movie occur, you never get the feeling you're watching a contrived conversation written by someone else, you get the feeling you're watching real life unfold. That's a hallmark of a good scriptwriter and the people who wrote this deserve credit for the story.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it never lets itself become too complicated and lends itself to a lot of funny situations. Fast-talking Dylan and socially naive Jez (Futterman and Townsend) are two con men trying to raise money to build their dream house. They end up enlisting Georgina's (short-haired Kate Beckinsale in a beautiful role from her pre-Hollywood Glamourpuss days) help on a particular scam. Soon she discovers what they're up to and the story unfolds from there, with both Dylan and Jez seemingly falling for Georgie. Here again, the movie doesn't nosedive and morph into a conventional love story; rather, the romance builds in a backdrop to the main story and culminates in a heartwarming finale. As for Dan and Jez, some of their schemes may not be very believable and yet you cant help but be amused by the way they go about implementing them. <br /><br />This film is a good reason why small budget comedy romances are popular - simply put, they work. On every level. Watching this film gives you the same kind of feeling as watching While you were Sleeping, for example. For the sheer sweetness of the film and for Kate Beckinsale's performance, I'd give it 7 on 10.\",\n",

I won\\'t give away any of the story, except to say that the has a nice, unexpected twist. An excellent date movie, or even to take in with a couple of close friends. You may not laugh out loud the whole time like you did at \"There\\'s Something About Mary\" or other slapstick comedies, but you\\'ll definitely be smiling the whole time, and by the time the credits role you\\'ll simply be in a much better mood than you were when you started.',\n",

I was very surprised to see the mixed reviews, it is hard to work out what there is not to like in this thoroughly likable movie - occassionally clever, sometimes sappy, possibly a little predictable - but never unlikeable.

Dionne Warwick. So anyway to make a long story short, I searched (in vain) for the soundtrack for nigh on a year but to no avail. Anyway, then one day I was at the video store (Major Video, before Blockbuster decided to buy that too) and I saw it and thought \"Jaysis, there\\'s something I need to see!\" It had that snazzy-looking retro box, too, and I was in a happy mood, so I gladly went home and popped it in.<br /><br />This must have been the cheeriest movie I\\'d seen in years. It made me think of Bringing Up Baby it was so happy (and that\\'s a good thing, by the way). Kate Beckinsale is absolutely charming, the American guy is lots of fun, and the English guy has the great sense to be charming AND insanely cute in that odd way that the British have. The movie has a plot, sure, but it doesn\\'t matter. You should just watch it and be hap-hap-happy! Revel in the retro-kitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that English guy\\'s striped t-shirt. It\\'s the best pick-me-up since Bounty (or, you know, whatever).

Their plans are big - they need a vast sum in order to move from their (ivory) tower to townhouse and hire - in typically unconventional fashion - a secretary to help them organise their income. Kate Beckinsdale's Georgie is far too lovely a PA to allow things to continue between the friends as smoothly as it had and soon they are on the back foot with only the fresh object of their contention to bail them out.<br /><br />Stuart Townsend and Dan Futterman (especially the latter) are good value and engage with the nuttiness of their ruses to the extent that you just go along with it all.

And I have to say, Kate Beckinsale, 'Emma' (1997) (TV) series fame, is a winsome doll.

The story is about two swindlers who tries to earn a lot of money by tricking people in different ways. None of the ways they do this are funny at all. It\\'s supposed to be a comedy, but personally I didn\\'t laugh one single time during the movie. In addition, the story really sucks, especially because they threw a bit of romance on top of it.

How can your heart not melt? The acting by the male leads is strong enough (mostly - the 'why do I have to get so technical?' scene falters a bit) to make you invest emotionally in Dylan and Jez' quest despite the fact that - all soft-heartedness aside - they are two lying, selfish, close to morally bankrupt con-merchants. By the end of the film you'll be cheering them on.<br /><br />What am I saying? By five minutes in you'll be cheering them on! Yes, it's full of clichés. Yes, it's pretty predictable. Yes, it's soppy. But this film proves that you can get away with anything if you have lovable characters and a fantastic soundtrack (see also Ocean's 11).

By this time you are clawing the stuffing out of your couch.<br /><br />I hate these people for having wasted a night out of my life.<br /><br />Dan Futterman, a kind of low-rent baby Richard Gere, plays the American the English love to hate - smug, glib, an updated version of \"over-paid, over-sexed and over here.\" <br /><br />Stuart Townsend plays a shambling English wonk, good hearted and socially undeveloped.

Ewan McGregor, in his very much younger days, presents the best performance of his career (alongside \"Trainspotting\"); in a way it\\'s a pity that he showed so much promise early on but, although always very likable, he was sub-par in many movies that followed. The guy that plays the neurotic, stuttering Welshmen is simply brilliant. I enjoyed that character very much; nearly every scene with him was a hilarious joy. The actor who plays the primitive, daft corporal is very good, too. The middle-aged army guys were played by familiar faces, very good actors, and last, but not least, we have Louise Germaine here playing the femme fatale. She was a PERFECT choice: her innocent face matched her character\\'s shallowness and stupidity very well, plus a very sexy woman. (A couple of nude scenes with her were not a drawback.) I wonder why I\\'ve barely seen her anywhere apart from this TV series...<br /><br />The musical sequences may appear strange at first, but once one gets accustomed to them, they actually give us a nice distraction from some of the tension that goes on. The songs are to the most part quite pleasant 50s oldies, so no harm done. (No Madonna or Aerosmith, thank God, nor would have I expected that kind of crap, of course...)

And I don't believe I've seen a more passionate kick to the groin than the one given by Albert Finney. All in all, Looker would probably not stand up next to today's movies, but it has a charm about it. It must have made some kind of impression on me as a child to remain in my head for the past 25 years. Recommended rental. Buy it if you like off-beat, quasi-mainstream movies. I bought it and plan on getting good use out of it. Perfect for unsuspecting house guests.\",\n",
       " 'Today\\'s audiences are a bit spoiled and jaded. This was a great movie for it\\'s time. (Yes, I still have a copy of it on beta format) It is also kind of prophetic since the advancements in computer animation. At some point, real actors will no longer be needed. Hmmmmmm. There is also a \"looker\" gun that sends out a light pulse that causes the victim to \"freeze\" and loose chunks of time. (Sounds a little familiar -- anyone seen MIB?) There is the look into the plastic surgery and the need to look perfect (that\\'s where the title comes in). Albert Finney and Susan Dey make an unlikely pairing in this \"futuristic\" sci-fi drama. Anyway, this is worth checking out. So grab a Tab soda, relax, and try to find a copy of this movie.',\n",
       " \"It seems that people watch this movie only to give it a below par ratings. Well I liked this picture and the three others that were with me also liked it too. For 1981 I would consider it pretty high tech but for today a little dated, but when I watch any movie I always want to know when it was made so I won't judge it by contemporary standards. We all liked it and I will give it a solid 8/10.\",\n",
